*What happened across the campaigns this month.*

## C07 · Hopeful End-Times

**Weeks 6–9 · Little Akiton, Absalom Station**

The party visited **Castle-Counting**, a bizarre and wonderful shop run by the dwarf **Ophelius Berrus** — part clockmaker, part arms dealer, all heart. Hundreds of timepieces tick in perfect sync. Guns line the walls. A grandfather clock labelled "Korvosian Palace" sits out of place among the tech.

**Chua** had a deep conversation with Ophelius about harmonic variance and chose an uncalibrated Aeon Rifle over the fancier model — because he could *feel* it was the right fit for his warp field. Ophelius was visibly impressed: *"Not many people can hear variance in a harmonic field."*

**Miyu** stole the show by synchronising five of Ophelius's clocks through dance alone — his chromatic fur pulsing in time with the pendulums, turning the shop into a rippling aurora of colour and brass. Ophelius watched in awe. **Alita** tested weapons on the hard-light firing range.

Two new faces joined the crew. **Rune**, a deaf Vlaka courier, reached out telepathically to comfort the newcomer — a genuinely touching moment. **Lowda Medina**, a towering 14-foot Sarcesian who can see and speak with the dead, arrived battered and overwhelmed, accompanied by dozens of ghosts only he can see. A ghost child asked him *"Can you see me? Really see me?"* and the whole shop went quiet.

**★Super Idol Livy★** returned in full broadcast chaos. The party is now gearing up to head to Dock 3 for a smuggling job.

## C06 · Kibwe

**Weeks 6–9 · Kibwe streets → somewhere far away**

The fight against the **White Flame Slime** reached its explosive conclusion. Round 1 was a masterclass in teamwork — **Fierce Leopard** carved into it for 42 damage, **Daichi** landed a devastating Attack of Opportunity crit for 29, and **Tarsus** counterspelled the slime's teleport mid-escape. 143 total damage in one round.

The slime fought back hard. It tried to swallow half the party — Daichi and Kieran got caught inside, taking massive force damage. Then in Round 2, it tried to teleport again. **Tal'lysae** (master in Slime Lore) screamed for Fierce Leopard to step INTO the portal.

He trusted her. He stepped through.

**Fierce Leopard vanished.** He woke up on a crumbling platform in an endless void — paralysed, vomiting blood, surrounded by an impossible sight. A ghostly dwarf named **Bashevis** was waiting. He showed Leopard something terrifying on a cosmic scale and delivered a warning: *"That is coming. Coming for you all."* He spoke of a mysterious flame, older than anything, and urged Leopard to find it.

The platform was disintegrating. Bashevis used the last of his fading essence to push Leopard back through the closing rift. Back in Kibwe, the rest of the party found 300 GP of slime parts and a missing barbarian.

## C00 · Riddleport

**Weeks 6–9 · The Silver Succubi, Riddleport**

A social chapter at Marlo's casino. **Rax** played the calm centre of gravity, managing the hyperactive **Lenma Moonshine** while bonding with **Callie Dusk-Barrel**, the bar's owner. Callie dropped some history: Moonshine got fired from this very bar two years ago for being too drunk *on shift*, was rehired the next morning, and never showed up. She still owes Callie an apology.

**Necrila** had a fascinating exchange with **Eliola**, a Cyphermage initiate studying ancient magic from the Sin Empire. Eliola was more curious than frightened by the severed-head-carrying, shark-toothed stranger — she wanted to understand the "magical attraction" Necrila described. Meanwhile **Gobu** overcame his fear of Necrila long enough to befriend Eliola, then wandered off to find the band.

Gobu discovered a battered **vending machine** bolted to the wall ("GAS FORGE PROVISIONS — NO REFUNDS, NO COMPLAINTS"). The mechanism jammed and spat out two items for the price of one — a healing potion and a mysterious unlabelled dark green vial. Lucky day.

Marlo the crime lord is on his way downstairs to see the party's prisoner, Beltias. Callie has begged everyone to behave. Necrila ended the month eyeing the caged imp like a predator sizing up dinner.

## C09 · Metal City

**Weeks 6–9 · The Stargazer (pirate vessel), brig**

The party woke up restrained in a pirate brig with a dead companion's charred remains on the floor. A cleaning bot tried to clean the corpse and short-circuited. Then a second automaton arrived — **Ooofy**, a mismatched janitor bot with a secret brilliant mind.

**Joo-Dee** spotted it immediately and struck up a whispered conversation. Ooofy analysed the corpse with scientific precision, revealing it had been mid-transformation through an unstable portal. He admitted to secretly reading stolen engineering journals: *"I'm not supposed to read engineering journals... I'm not supposed to do a lot of things."*

Joo-Dee's recruitment pitch was perfect: *"We could use a brilliant robot right now. One who reads engineering journals. One who would be fully permitted to read them on our crew."* Ooofy freed everyone, returned their gear plus his own hidden stash (force field generator, phase shield, magboots, grenades), and walked out like nothing happened.

The party rolled stealth initiative. **Damon** got a 28. The guard **Dekker** didn't stand a chance — Damon sniped, **Holis** sent his holographic eidolon for kicks, **Arctus** cast Enhance Weapon. Dekker is very, very dead. The party is free and armed aboard a pirate ship. The rest of the crew doesn't know yet.

## C01 · Doomsday Funtime

**Weeks 6–9 · Temple of Pharasma, Raven Grow (Day 1/30)**

A quiet but significant month. Session 272 saw the party arrive at the Temple of Pharasma. An acolyte approached — and **Carnon absolutely demolished** the social encounter with a pitch-perfect formal Pharasmian greeting. He used the precise archaic liturgical form for her exact rank, the correct gestures (palm-up sign of candour), and a sacred register that told her *this person truly knows the faith*.

The acolyte, **Sister Eladria** (cleric and record keeper), was visibly flustered and impressed. The party asked about building a magically enchanted statue to honour the fallen Professor. Eladria referred them up the chain to **Father Vauran** but was clearly intrigued.

Where did Carnon pull that knowledge from? He's not a Pharasma worshipper. It came from somewhere deep inside — a memory that isn't his own. The month ends with introductions still happening. **Viki** perked up at the words "record keeper."

## C04 · Magni Watch

**Weeks 6–9 · Kobold-occupied trade house, Magnimar**

The Watch discovered a trade house fortified into a kill box by desperate kobolds. **Nadya** overheard their plans in Draconic — names, positions, trap placements. **Changer** (the city golem) confirmed: *"This is not a defensive formation. This is a kill box."*

**Kitt** questioned whether someone was manipulating the kobolds into this level of aggression. Nadya cut through the ethics debate: *"All the 'morality' and 'why' crap is for the Justice Court."* The team climbed the building from the back, bypassing all the front-door traps.

Changer walked to the front and formally demanded surrender. No answer. The Watch dropped through the roof into the fountain room — and found a **young female kobold holding a dead man's switch** connected to the building's boiling water system. She was shaking, scared, but determined: *"Stay back. I pull this, everyone gets boiled. BOILED!!!"*

**Kitt** is hidden behind a crate, unnoticed. The rest of the Watch face a nervous kobold with a detonator and a room full of superheated water.

## C05 · Grand Explorers

**Weeks 6–9 · Gnomish fortress, hydraulic control room**

A technical puzzle month. The party found a gnomish hydraulic system — a massive pressurised water tank connected to dozens of pipes, valve wheels, and gauges, all labelled in Gnomish. Between **Illiani**, **Cyrus**, and **Axtra**, they deciphered the labels and understood the system.

The tank was dangerously over-pressurised — gauges deep in the red. The pipes connect to hydraulic locks on reinforced doors. This valve system is the only way into the central building. Three emergency vents needed bleeding in sequence before the main valve could be safely turned.

**Axtra** took point. First valve: success. Second valve: the seal slipped. Hero Point reroll — got it. Steam screamed, gauges dropped to green, and two sets of locks disengaged: the reinforced doors into the fortress's highest section AND a broom closet.

Both doors are now open. What's behind them is anyone's guess.

## C08 · Theria

**Weeks 6–9 · Open fields → Wanhoop Swamp → unnamed village**

The party was released from military custody and headed south toward the swamp with a new companion — **Leaf**, an adorable plant construct created by the goddess Atrix. Leaf's entire vocabulary is *"I am Leaf!"* but they have impeccable direction sense, deadly shortsword skills, and sticky fingers (immediately stole Heron's coin pouch).

On a bridge over a rot pit, the group fought an **oversized Cockatrice**. Three rounds of combat: **Heron** tanked with his shield (took a crit peck near the eye but made his Fort save against petrification), **Berekit** sniped with spellstrikes, and **Leaf** delivered the killing blows from behind, then looked at their bloody hands and said: *"I am Leaf?"*

They reached a **decaying village** deep in the swamp — crumbling buildings, melancholy residents, almost deserted. At the inn they met **Quacksalver**, a hobgoblin alchemist. Heron was immediately horrified by his mutagens ("WHAT ABOUT APPLES BEREKIT. WHAT ABOUT APPLES"), but Berekit was won over by the promise of coffee. Quacksalver demonstrated by extending his arms to rubber-band proportions.

The innkeeper's broom snapped — the second this month. The village's accelerating decay started about two weeks ago. Something is very wrong here.
