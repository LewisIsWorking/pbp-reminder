**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-08 01:48:47):
Selenor's suspended retribution is triggered when the nearest Scorpion strides.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-06-08 02:25:17):
More when it moves more than its movement speed.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-18 12:09:37):
What next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-18 12:42:55):
We are not in encounter mode.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-06-18 15:19:27):
Describe the scene before the next challenge?

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-06-18 15:54:58):
Is there a door to the next challenge? A hole? A Guardian? Did the guardian of this challenge say anything after we beat it?

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-06-19 20:32:04):
Can we get the lore drop from the secret reserach?

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-06-19 20:32:08):
Or does allisee need a check?

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-06-19 21:50:16):
@MrNegetZ, you're choice, I doubt the professor cares if you take a while

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-19 22:22:24):
I'd say a wizard could spend their refocus time reading arcane books.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-21 01:42:17):
*[image]* The group descend...

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-06-21 01:43:06):
Very descent

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-06-21 01:51:00):
Writer of Saran Wrap's field manual, Guardian of the third challenge. He holds a key. His other hand has a spellbook within an air bubble. He is not useful. 
Sundisk says 9 am. 
Moondial says. 9 am.

Selenor gets:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-21 06:53:44):
ONE-THIRD OF THE FINAL SPELL.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-21 06:53:53):
AND ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF A SANDITT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-22 15:51:41):
The professor is flabbergasted.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-22 15:53:00):
Professor Ionacu Lozar:
"You.... you did it!
You got a third of the final spell!"

Professor Ionacu Lozar gazes at the fully evolved cosmic butterfly:
"It is so beautiful."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-22 15:53:47):
*[image]* Cardigan seems pleased but looks at the Sanditt and pets it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-22 15:54:33):
Cardigan says:
"In our Riddleport adventure, I love having Eldamons.
I'm happy we finally got this little guy, he's so cute!!!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-22 16:07:56):
Professor Ionacu Lozar continues after adjusting his glasses:
"But keep secret what the butterfly IS.
You already have many, many priceless artefacts upon your person.
Still, this alone would make you a prime target for any bounty hunter, government, monster from other planes or, well, anyone."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-22 16:14:25):
Professor Ionacu Lozar continues:
"....just don't lose it. Please."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-06-22 16:27:24):
"Speaking of heartbreak, do we have a plan now that we have this sandit? Do we just go and apologize to the brothel lady, and then what? Ask politely for her secrets?" Carnon paces a little as they talk.
"Can someone polymorph into this sandit, or perhaps looks through their eyes as a way to infiltrate the brothel if asking politely doesn't work?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-06-22 16:32:06):
"Perhaps the great priest of Nethys could aid us with some illusion magic"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-22 16:33:51):
@MrNegetZ

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-06-22 17:50:53):
"That sounds like an idea. Lets make our way there." Carnon stops pacing, and starts going for the exit

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-06-23 22:00:09):
Are we able to leave the sphinx, and leave the sandstorm/tornado?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-23 23:12:03):
The sandstorm is gone.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-06-23 23:22:58):
So we make our way to the academy so, hoping it's not too late to be able to gain access to the libraries

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-24 00:32:50):
It is almost 10:00.

So the university will be open by now.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-06-24 16:27:30):
So we make our way there, then. Unless the professor has anything to say to us before we leave

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-06-24 16:30:26):
(bro is hogging the PP)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-24 16:38:01):
That Selenor can use if he wishes.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-24 16:38:09):
Or Carnon we can jump into there.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-06-24 16:38:24):
use it for what?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-24 16:38:25):
In one I'd like to do the professor chat.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-06-24 16:38:45):
bruh

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-06-24 16:38:59):
*[gif]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-24 20:54:14):
The party is in the desert outside the black sphinx.
🏜️ 

The 50+ archeologists are all swarming into and around the black sphinx.

Professor Ionacu Lozar:
"I'll need to tell the expedition group about Zelvuul turning to ash.

They were a Demon Vrock, also known as a wrath demon.

I assume the living library's defences instantly evaporated her due to her being a true fiend, not just a tiefling.

It could also have been her connection to sin magic but Selenor is wearing the shards of sin so I find this unlikely."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-24 20:57:18):
Professor Ionacu Lozar passes Selenor a small set of documents:
"Here's a copy of their personnel file.
I believe they may have been a cypher mage in case that's relevant to you."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-24 21:00:52):
Professor Ionacu Lozar:
"As for the lenses...
I don't have any love for the Osirion administration and by that you know I mean Amenopheus the Sapphire Sage.

So you have a choice.

If you want, destroy the lenses.

Weaken the Osirion faction.

Otherwise, delivering them to Amenopheus will strengthen the faction.

I recommend their destruction.

Keleri will not punish yous.

She does not work for Osirion and I will speak in your defence."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-06-24 21:22:41):
Selenor rather confused says "Very well then, also don't forget that you own me an explanation on how you don't age"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-06-24 21:24:29):
After the conversation Selenor asks Allissee if he can destroy the lenses "Well the professor said that it is ok to destroy them. May I do it?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-28 00:26:24):
Professor Ionacu Lozar:
"Well, Selenor, I think that after the day we've had that telling you the truth is the least I can do."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-28 00:26:44):
Professor Ionacu Lozar raises his hand to you and it turns to water then back again to flesh.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-28 00:27:45):
Professor Ionacu Lozar:
"I am a water genie.
I am effectively immortal and immune to the ravages of time. 
I do not age.
Kill me and I will be reborn upon death."
