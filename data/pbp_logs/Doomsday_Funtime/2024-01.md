Following Selenor, the party slid down the rubbish chute, finding themselves in a vast slimy cavern.

How dark is it?

**None** (2024-01-15 23:36:05):
Perception to see how relatively vast the cavern is and if I can identify the slime / source of the slime.

**None** (2024-01-15 23:36:30):
And if there is a bunch of rubbish down here or where it might be going from here?
