Professor Ionacu Lozar:

"Well, Selenor.

I would say yes and no.

Mortals can indeed become genies...
Though the transformation is extraordinarily rare and typically requires profound magical intervention or exposure to the raw elemental forces of the Inner Planes.

I have heard legends in my time that, in the age of legend, spellcasters developed forbidden rituals combining elements of reincarnation, plane shifting, and mythic-level transmutation magic. 

These gruelling processes involve binding one's soul to an elemental plane while maintaining consciousness through the transformation."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-07-03 09:33:10):
Selenor will use chronoler lore to remember the genie king name as well as the rovagog spawn that they were after
