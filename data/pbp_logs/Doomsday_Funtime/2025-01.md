Selenor has gotten his two side quests (not to be completed anytime remotely soon).
- Puppets.
- Sphere of Light Candle Magic.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-06 04:22:17):
So the group now has to complete Torch's other quests.

**Justin Sherfield** (2025-01-06 06:26:45):
(Perks to being a side character. You accept the side quest and it becomes Selenor's responsibility)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-15 13:30:56):

Cardigan says to Selenor:
"Since we are in Osirion for a wee while, perhaps we could check out a few...uh...landmarks."

Cardigan smiles, sheepishly.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-15 15:35:12):
" so what do we do now Cardigan?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-15 15:36:13):
Selenor gives Cardigan a thumb up

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-15 15:37:29):
Carnon chimes in. 
"Speaking of the burnt bozo, Selenor could you remind Carnon what else is left for us to accomplish?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-15 15:39:10):
Selenor shrugs "ask Alissee"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-15 15:39:48):
Carnon turns to Allisee. 
"Are you able to answer the question?"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-15 15:45:40):
"Okay, let Carnon hear this plan for those secrets"

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-01-15 15:46:19):
"That's the plan"

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-01-15 15:47:01):
"Well i also have the gift that'll make her a bit more friendly"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-15 15:48:56):
Carnon doesn't have lungs, and yet still he lets out a low sigh. Under their breathe he mumbles 

"No wonder the world is still ending..." And looks ahead. 

"Where do we start looking for this assassin?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-15 19:39:22):
"What was her name again?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-15 19:41:11):
"We just need information from her no? What if we were to make a deal with her. We get the info from the gang boss and she can do whatever she wants with him"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-16 17:25:54):
Selenor shrugs "it was worth a try"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-17 20:02:50):
