Sister Eladria continues:

"The temple keeps records of everyone who passes through Raven Grow. 

Births. 

Deaths. 

Marriages. 

Burials. 

Property transfers when estates are wound up."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:45:39):
Eladria explains:
"Every soul that passes on — we write it down. Name. Date. Cause of death, when we know it. Where they're interred."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:47:32):
Eladria says:
"The Lady of Graves knows every soul. We try to honour that. Make sure no one is forgotten."

Eladria says:
"The Lady of Graves has no quarrel with the unaligned. She receives all souls regardless."
A small pause.
Eladria adds:
"I hope the changes have treated you gently, Carnon."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:49:17):
Eladria:

"If you wish to speak about what has happened while you are all in town, I am happy to speak with you."

Eladria blushes very slightly.

**DragonFox** (2026-03-01 00:50:56):
Viki: That is quite a lot of responsibility to hold that many records..

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:08:37):
Eladria says to Viki:

"It is but... I love it. 
It connects me to my faith."

She glances back at the temple behind her.

Father Vauran approaches:
"Greetings. 
I see you are all still here."
