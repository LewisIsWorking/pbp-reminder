Sister Eladria continues:

"The temple keeps records of everyone who passes through Raven Grow. 

Births. 

Deaths. 

Marriages. 

Burials. 

Property transfers when estates are wound up."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:45:39):
Eladria explains:
"Every soul that passes on — we write it down. Name. Date. Cause of death, when we know it. Where they're interred."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:47:32):
Eladria says:
"The Lady of Graves knows every soul. We try to honour that. Make sure no one is forgotten."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:48:30):
Eladria says:
"The Lady of Graves has no quarrel with the unaligned. She receives all souls regardless."
A small pause.
Eladria adds:
"I hope the changes have treated you gently, Carnon."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:49:17):
Eladria:

"If you wish to speak about what has happened while you are all in town, I am happy to speak with you."

Eladria blushes very slightly.

**DragonFox** (2026-03-01 00:50:56):
Viki: That is quite a lot of responsibility to hold that many records..

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:08:37):
Eladria says to Viki:

"It is but... I love it. 
It connects me to my faith."

She glances back at the temple behind her.

Father Vauran approaches:
"Greetings. 
I see you are all still here."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:43:26):
What next? :)

**DragonFox2000** (2026-03-01 02:04:16):
Viki: *He nodded to the bishop*
"Yes, just a temporary stay. I think you have heard of me, father?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:27:46):
Father Vauran:

"I saw you earlier at the funeral."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:40:47):
Father Vauran:

"And people saw you flying around earlier.

Hard to miss a big black dragon."

Father Vauran smiles at you.

**DragonFox2000** (2026-03-01 02:54:44):
Viki: *He nodded briefly*
"I called Viki, I am what you call Vold Dragon, I was recently scouted by the guild member as an adventurer. But fear not that I am not a feral beast and I'm quite a...curious being."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:59:29):
Father Vauran:

"That's good.
There are quite a few black dragons in these lands; they eat undead, which is very much appreciated."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:59:38):
Father Vauran:

"So, how may I help you?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:59:51):
Father Vauran:

"Did I catch you lot saying something about a statue?"

**DragonFox2000** (2026-03-01 03:19:15):
Viki: "My allies wish to build a statue of a fallen Professor, if I recall."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 23:04:35):
Vauran says:
"Tell me what you have in mind."
He's not dismissing the idea.
He's not approving it either.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 23:12:40):
Father Vauran:

"The Professor was not a man of our faith, so I wonder why you are asking me?
Though of course I have lived here my whole life and certainly would have an opinion."
