I'm away from my PC

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 20:35:55):
LAW GOLEM OF CHAOS FIGHT

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-02 21:17:57):
It's harmed by lawful and sonic magic

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-02 21:18:06):
That golem is not a law golem anymore it's a chaos golem.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-02 21:18:31):
I'm just going to smack him with Sin Reaver powered moonbear.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-08-02 23:27:47):
I thought I sent you on a date with Koromun

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-02 23:28:00):
And got blasted with all the knowledge in the world.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-08-02 23:28:29):
Damn when will Selenor get blasted with the secrets of magic

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-08-11 18:22:30):
Not sure if it changes anything, but the vitality damage is vitality or precision damage, depending on which is worse for the enemy

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 18:24:07):
Could roll the damage to deal precision?

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-08-11 18:24:48):
I tried to add it as precision damage but precision didn't show up as a damage type

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-08-11 18:26:48):
yeah

@Mossssssssssssssssssssssssss did you get a crit on the recall knowledge on known weakness?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-13 02:13:17):
Selenor turn:
Stride up to behind the golem to flank
Strike(critical hit)
Raise shield.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-13 02:14:24):
(Guy has to do 2 saves and is clumsy and enfeebled 1).

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-13 02:24:10):
(If cardigan want she can try to counteract my stupefied with clear mind.)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 16:32:39):
The Chaos-Law Golem succeeds both other checks.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 16:39:22):
@Mossssssssssssssssssssssssss

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 16:40:18):
The Golem has taken 2 instances of damage: Selenor & Carnon.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 16:40:25):
It invokes CHAOS x2.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 16:41:53):
@Nemesiux 

Selenor critically succeeds and is unaffected by CHAOS.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-08-13 16:42:06):
Selenor is too stupid for chaos

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 16:42:30):
@Mossssssssssssssssssssssssss 

You also critically succeed against CHAOS.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-08-13 16:42:50):
That hellknight training paying off

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 16:42:56):
Oh  no sorry I rolled using Selenor

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 16:43:06):
@Mossssssssssssssssssssssssss You critically fail, reroll ?

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-08-13 16:43:33):
Is it a will save?

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-08-13 16:45:48):
Nah, no reroll. Let's see what this does

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 16:46:15):
You gain +10 reach.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 16:46:19):
But you are clumsy 2.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 16:47:17):
These effects are permanent until this golem is defeated.

Viole didn't act

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:10:02):
Cardigan's turn.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:10:11):
2 actions: Clear Mind cast at 4th rank.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:10:16):
Casting at 4th rank was a bad choice on my part.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:10:34):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:11:10):
Hero pointed into a 40, which is a success, but because the effect is 6th rank, it is only suppressed.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:11:25):
If you failed to counteract the effect but you would have if its counteract rank were 2 lower, instead suppress the effect until the beginning of your next turn. The effect's duration doesn't elapse while it's suppressed. This spell can't counteract or suppress conditions that are part of curses, diseases, or a natural state of the target.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:12:01):
On Round 3 the effect of Allisee's stupified 2 will return.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:12:05):
END OF PLAYER SIDE.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:13:18):
Chaos infected Law-Golem's turn.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:13:26):
Action 1: Step towards Viole, Carnon and Haku.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:13:41):
With 27 in AC, Carnon looks like he is the easiest target and the golem strikes twice.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:14:28):
Hit and Crit.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:14:38):
(29 and 38)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:15:26):
On the first strike, his first rears backwards and astral forces swirl around the clenched fist, slamming into Carnon's chest, dealing FORCE DAMAGE!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:15:51):
30 damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:16:05):

117/142

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:16:37):
2nd strike.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:17:01):
The golem's other first becomes massive and covered in THICK stone.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:17:08):
Bludgeoning damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:17:14):
54 damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:17:16):

63/142

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:18:06):
Carnon's sappy blood covers the golems fists.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:18:15):
The Golems glows, the blood is DRAINED into the golem.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:18:20):
AND CHAOS IS INVOKED.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:19:37):
Chaos 1: Selenor is Slowed 2 for 1 minute, concluding on turn 11.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:19:39):
Chaos 2:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:20:52):
HEAVY WEIGHTS made of a crystal-like glass grow across Viole's arms, making them Enfeebled 2.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:21:03):
Selenor got a 30.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:21:06):
@Nemesiux Reroll ?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-13 20:21:33):
No freaking way that dude has a 40 spell DC

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-13 20:21:54):
And slowed 2 for one minute on a normal fail is BS

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:22:06):
@Askarans 

Chaos #3 tries to overwhelm your mind with CHAOS.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:22:07):
But

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:22:17):
You take a breathe, allowing the air to fill your lungs and calm your mind.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:22:20):
You are fine.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:25:49):
30 less damage!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-13 20:25:58):
Carnon HP: 88/142.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-08-13 20:26:27):
Yeah

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-08-13 20:26:44):
I think I named it gunpowder flash on my character sheet since I had to add it manually

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-13 20:27:58):
Isn't fighting defensively a PF1e thing?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-13 20:28:02):
He uses the lighting defensively reaction to raise his AC by 4 for some reason and he dodged the first and makes the other a normal hit?

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-08-13 20:28:27):
Bro doesn't know about the Deus ex homebrew

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-08-13 20:42:01):
L

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-13 20:42:03):
So it's technically an 11

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-13 20:42:18):
But it's still a 1 on the dice.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-13 20:42:28):
You would've succeeded but the degree gets 1 worse.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-13 20:43:17):
*[image]* Viole's turn:
1st a : Step/stride up to the golem
2nd a : Cast elemental betrayal(Fire) APPLY EFFECT BEFORE APPLYING DAMAGE. Used the familiar ability on carnon
3rd a: Strike hit

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-13 20:46:13):
*[image]* 1st Action Leading Dance, move 5ft away from group, 5ft to the right.
2nd Action Activate Scarf, become concealed
3rd Action  Targeting Finisher, Arms

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-13 20:46:13):

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-13 21:10:14):
*[image]* Alisse's turn: 
1st action: Explosive bloodrage spellshape
2nd action: Blood Surge (Stide and explode)
I failed the save so i take 17-6(explosive bloodrage bonus damage excludes me)
so 11 sonic damage.
It has to do reflex save
3rd action: Silencing strike HIT so it has to do the DC31 fortitude save against getting stunned.
I take 6 damage from the splash
IT TAKES 7 EXTRA LAWFUL DAMAGE FROM THE HIGH VALE BLADE SIN REAVER'S EFFECT (that was high vale ritualed onto moonbear)
I already applied all damage on myself (the 11 and 6 from the splash and the spell). Some of it was absorbed by bloodrage temp hp
I also took account of it's position after Askaran's turn

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-13 21:10:14):
*[image]*

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-13 21:41:07):
Carnon's turn:
1a :Running reload steping back
2 - 3 a: Coilling serpents. (will do the strike when he gets put off guard from @Askarans finisher
Put the spark in gaze

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-14 02:15:55):
Critical success.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-14 02:16:20):
Golem 47 is BADLY INJURED.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-14 02:16:47):
Also the Golem has 5 stacks of C H A O S.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 02:16:49):
Remember

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-14 02:17:51):
24 damage.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 02:18:06):
Also don't forget the extra lawful damage

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 02:18:13):
From sin reaver

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 02:18:34):
That also what he's harmed by if I remember

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 02:29:07):
Also you didn't move the golem to the right

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 02:29:52):
*[image]* Golem and haku move to the right 5ft due to leading dance.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 03:59:38):
Also if it's not dead somebody should check how to get rid of chaos

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 03:59:43):
There's probably a way

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-14 07:54:14):
I'll apply all this now.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-14 07:54:18):
Then maybe switch worlds.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-14 08:08:06):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-14 08:08:15):
I also added LAW as a custom homebrew damage type.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 08:08:21):
Oh

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 08:08:28):
Doesn't it trigger something?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-14 08:09:17):
Actually, no, it's part of strike damage, so I don't think so?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 08:09:37):
Well there are no more lawful damage spells anyways?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 08:09:54):
Spirit damage replaced all alignment damage

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-14 08:10:33):
IT just doesn't resist it.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 08:11:03):
But it took more damage from my 17(took like 24?) sonic damage?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 08:11:16):
So its weak to sonic on top of being harmed by it?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-14 08:12:17):
But that was a spell or magical ability.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 08:12:56):
I guess the splash and lawfull damage are part of the strike so it doesn't take extra?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 08:13:20):
But it takes extra(or a different amount cause idk) from sonic/spirit damage spells?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 08:13:57):
Ok bro should be almost dead. SELENOR STRIKE!

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 08:14:06):
He only has 1 action anyways...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-14 08:14:47):
He is at Death's Door...

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 08:15:05):
SELENOR STRIKE BRO!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-14 08:15:16):
((( Take his turn ? )))

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 08:15:28):
I'll try but I'm at an airport

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 08:18:45):
(accidentally increased his slowed value)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-14 08:22:13):
*[image]* SELENOR STRIKE normal hit

“Hmm to be compared to a mighty warrior is no insult. So thank you ma’am!” He says with unabashed glee.  “Although we yaogaui are often the core behind the chaos, my people dedicated themselves to strength for those exact same reasonings. To become more than monsters.”

**Jay Myers / Jalen Hill | #1 Vaasha** (2025-08-16 06:20:20):
