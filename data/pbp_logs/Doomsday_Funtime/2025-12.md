**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-12-01 20:46:45):
After the combat is over Selenor approaches the daemon's corpse named The Butcher and beheads him. Then he turns his attention to the she devil and opens his mouth wide and the tiny blackhole absorbs the remaining parts of her soul (he already stole some using soul siphon) and then proceeds to throw her corpse in his bag of holding

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-01 20:51:39):
Cardigan flexes her hands, one ghoul flesh, one her normal purple flesh.
A small puff of purple light flashes around her:

"I feel....kinda stronger."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-12-01 21:00:00):
The void eye attempt what looks like a poor imitation of a smile on Selenor face "Indeed we are stronger. 

The daemons shall fall under our combine power void shell sister"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-12-01 21:01:05):
After this Selenor shakes his head and says 
" I am sorry about. 
The shell is just excited to be able to see now.  Especially you"

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-12-01 21:13:59):
While selenor is distracted with the corpses of his ennemies Alissee yoinks the butcher's weapon.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-12-01 21:28:09):
While allissee is distracted with yoinking the butcher's weapons, Carnon will yoink the monster parts

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-12-01 21:29:42):
No, he's holding them in his hands

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 10:36:42):
What next?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-10 16:27:25):
Derek is still in his room, huddled in fear.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-10 16:27:37):
Derek is shaking, the only sign he is alive.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-10 17:08:06):
Cardigan looks at Fuq Tank:

"So.... We don't need to kill your or should I practise my disintegration skills? 

I think I'm getting pretty good at it!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-10 17:08:16):
Cardigan makes thing gun noises at you.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-10 17:08:20):
@Verminatrix

**Bronwyn Liddle** (2025-12-12 20:15:13):
Fuq Tank: “No you don’t need to kill me” :3

**Bronwyn Liddle** (2025-12-12 20:27:52):
“…yes?”

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-12-12 20:33:51):
"Oke"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-12-13 17:15:44):
Selenor looks confused " what are you trying to punch?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-12-15 11:23:46):
Selenor then points at Derek "Who is that guy"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-12-18 12:44:38):
"I am confused. What demon?"

**Bronwyn Liddle** (2025-12-18 13:31:31):
“I’m not a pet, or a demon?”

**Bronwyn Liddle** (2025-12-18 14:05:10):
“Fuq tank”

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-22 16:14:13):
— Post Session 265 —

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-22 16:14:27):
The party have gotten the carnival card.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-22 16:14:37):
It seems different from the other destiny cards.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-23 01:00:29):
Cardigan:
"Oooh anyone else feel that?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-12-23 11:04:47):
"May I see it?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-23 16:15:21):
The second reason is much more important. 

You are the chronicler.

You have a certain....way with books.

In the past you have absorbed them.
Other times you have heard the whispers of magical books.

What is a harrow card if not a 1 page book?

It is through such a connection that you feel a small presence.


You feel her. 

You feel, somewhere out there in the universe is Amar Rookmoon. 

Not quite *fully* dead, not quite alive. 

If you get any insight from this, beyond the hope of saving Amar, then it is this:

The Harrower must save Amar.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-23 16:15:46):
And the Harrow, which cries out for its master's return craves the power of destiny.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-27 05:14:36):
