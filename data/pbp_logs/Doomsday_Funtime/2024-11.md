"May I get a reply to this situation? I know that you are using the husk to spy on me. The lich outsider knows that you walk the earth again...."

Selenor also turns to Danufair and says: "you have been awfully quiet. Don't you have anything to say about what has happen so far?"

Junima walks over to Andaisin, she reaches up to the tall, tall face and tears run down Junima's face.

Junima is quiet for a moment.
A long moment.

Junima:
"You have his features too..."

More tears flow.
