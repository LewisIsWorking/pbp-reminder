Katio senses there is an assassin nearby, and hide with the party to wait until the assassin leaves.

However, they still sense the present of assassin after hiding for 15 minutes.

"It seems the assassin is looking for something else, otherwise, the assassin won't stay so long. Let me sneak around and take a look." Kaito message the party.

Then Kaito takes out a potion, drink it. The party can notice Kaito and his clothing start blending into his surroundings, then disappeared.

Kaito start sneaking around and seek for the assassin.
