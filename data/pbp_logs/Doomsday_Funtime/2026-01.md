**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 04:06:24):
Cardigan is eating some fruit.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 04:06:49):
DragonFox 
@MrNegetZ 

Cardigan:
"A new dragon friend.
Pretty cool, huh, Allisee?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-05 18:33:27):
What next?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 05:50:19):
@MrNegetZ 
@Nemesiux 
@Mossssssssssssssssssssssssss 

Cardigan flicks some porridge at Allisee & Selenor.

Then looks at Carnon:
"Why is everyone so quiet this morning?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-10 00:57:16):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-10 08:17:18):
@Nemesiux wants to see the High Mourner.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-10 12:38:56):
Does the party go to the temple of Pharasma?

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2026-01-10 23:21:38):
Yee

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 03:17:02):
-= The Church of Pharasma =-

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:23:43):
Magnimar is the City of Monuments, and the Church of Pharasma is partially a monument itself.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:24:11):
This temple is from the age of legends.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:24:22):
Since then it has been restored, built around and expanded upon.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:24:49):
The building's foundation is Sin Empire stonework: massive blocks of rune-carved basalt and other stone.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:25:52):
The empire of sin built everything to last forever.

Pharasma and her faith have outlasted the end of that world and endure forever.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:26:27):
Rising from that foundation, the structure itself is pale blue-grey granite quarried from the Mind-spin Mountains.

The surface of the building is carved with endless interlocking spirals that catch light differently throughout the day.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:27:17):
At dawn, they seem to rotate sunwise. 

At dusk, widdershins (counterclockwise). 

The effect is not magical.

It is merely exceptional craftsmanship requiring a patient understanding of how stone and light converse.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:28:27):
One object dominates the Magnimarian church of Pharasma.

It makes travelers stop in the street.

It makes locals avert their eyes from habit.

The Monument of Pharasma.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:28:36):
A thirty-foot statue of the Lady of Graves stands before the entrance.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:29:14):
The statue is carved from a single block of white marble veined with dark silver.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:30:04):
The public knows this depiction well: a robed woman of serene authority.

Pharasma's features are obscured by a deep cowl.

One of her hands is extended in judgment while her other hand rests upon the pommel of a ceremonial dagger.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:31:29):
The spiral of fate winds around her feet. 

For she is: 

The Judge of Souls.
The Midwife. 
The Mortician.

The goddess who ensures all things pass as they should.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:34:36):
@Nemesiux 

With Selenor's Mastery of Magnimar Lore, you know that this statue is debated; it is odd.

Details that scholars debate and the clergy decline to explain.

Her cowl is carved too deeply.

The shadows within suggest no face at all, just darkness where features should be. 

 Her extended hand's fingers are perhaps a touch too long, too thin and strangely the joints have one knuckle more than human anatomy permits.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:35:14):
Anatomists who've studied the statue note the fingers possess an additional phalange, which means four segments instead of three.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:36:50):
The ceremonial dagger at her hip is also wrong: too long, the blade too curved, the handle seems to imply the possibility of dual wielding the dagger.

The dagger: the divine weapon of Pharasma.

Yet why does it look so wrong?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:37:33):
At the feet of the statue is an ancient sin-powered clockwork mechanism that tracks time's passage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:38:05):
Gears of brass and silver rotate in precise intervals: 

one for heartbeats, 

one for breaths, 

one for days, 

one for years, 

one for ages. 

When a gear completes its cycle, it clicks and begins again. 

The Lady does not move. 

She does not need to. Everything comes to her eventually.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:38:20):
The statue's pedestal bears words carved in Celestial, Common, and Requian (the language of the bone yard):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:38:29):
"THE SPIRAL TURNS. 

THE LADY WAITS. 

ALL SOULS COME HOME."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:39:15):
Tall windows of frosted glass line the church walls behind her, their panes etched with scenes of life's transitions: 

A mother in labour...

A child taking first steps... 

A warrior falling in battle... 

An elder closing their eyes for the last time... 

Birth and death are given equal weight, equal dignity. 

The spiral connects them all.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:39:51):
The entrance doors flank the statue's base.

Silver-chased darkwood, warm to the touch despite the metal.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:40:40):
The doors to the church (below the statue) are carved with the symbology of the psychopomps: the death angels of Pharasma.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:47:34):
@Nemesiux 

Selenor.
Your spirit sense tells you this is not a mortal being of life or unlife.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:49:15):
The Pharasmin Plague Doctor speaks to you.

The Plague Doctor's voice resonates from somewhere other than its throat.

You guess perhaps they speak from the staff...

Or perhaps nowhere physical at all.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:50:55):
Plague Doctor:

"Selenor. 

Your passage here was calculated to finish seventeen minutes ago. 

You are four minutes early. 

This creates paperwork."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:55:16):
Plague Doctor waits for a moment, not speaking.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:55:56):
The clockwork dial CLICKS above the Selenor and the rest of the group.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 05:58:05):
The Plague Doctor:
"The spiral acknowledges your arrival.
The Grand Councilwoman Neferpatra Ahnkamen, high priest of Pharasma may have banished you but the lady of the graves has not."

The plague doctor continues:
You may enter here today but leave your assumptions at the threshold. 
They will not serve you here.
I will be your guide, do not wander as your title would suggest.

The High Mourner lays awaiting us in the Garden of Endings.
Follow swiftly behind me.
We will arrive there is 3 minutes and 42 seconds."

The plague doctor checks an old brass clockwork time piece, attached on a silver chain that leads somewhere into his cloak.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:00:41):
The doors swing open as the plague doctor turns.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:00:49):
-= Inside the Church =-

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:01:25):
The reception stretches longer than the exterior suggests, a common trick of Pharasmin architecture.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:01:37):
This space bending trick to remind mortals that destinations are rarely as close as they appear.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:02:07):
Pews carved from pale ash-wood face an altar dominated by a ten-foot silver spiral.

The spiral rotates slowly on mechanisms hidden within the floor.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:02:23):
Each rotation takes exactly one minute. 

The spiral has completed this rotation for hundreds of years. 

It has never stopped. 

It has never needed maintenance.

Perhaps part of the original building?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:03:05):
The walls bear alcoves containing life-masks and death-masks arranged in pairs: plaster impressions taken at birth and at death, displayed together to show the full journey.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:03:10):
Some pairs span decades.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:03:14):
Some, tragically, show nearly identical infant faces.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:03:23):
The church does not discriminate in life & death.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:03:26):
The church records all passages.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:04:54):
Clerks in gray vestments move between stations.

Some attending to ledgers thick as tombstones: (births, deaths, marriages, the last rites requested for many years ahead.

Other Pharasmians are calibrating brass instruments that measure life force and divine energy. 

A cluster of mourners currently kneel before a side-altar dedicated to stillborn children, their grief held in practiced silence.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:05:17):
Nearly everyone stops what they are doing and silently stares at the group.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:05:47):
The previously silent room is still silent, but an awkward, heavy silence.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:06:12):
Somewhere deeper, an infant cries.

The church also serves as one of Magnimar's most respected midwiferies. 

Life and death. 

Always both. 

The same priestesses who ease souls into the world ease them out of it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:07:01):
A witch of Pharasma gestures toward a door at the reception's far end, marked with a blooming nightshade carved in jet:
"The Garden. She's awaiting you."

Her hushed words carry across the length of the room and to the ears of the group.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:07:21):
The Plague Doctor strides across the room with impossible grace.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:07:43):
You go through the door and through a consecrated passage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:07:58):
The Plague Doctor:
"Welcome to the Garden of Endings."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:08:41):
This garden should not exist. 

Magnimar's Keystone District is dense urban construction.

There is no room for a garden spanning what appears to be three acres or more. 

Yet here it grows, bounded by walls that are always exactly fifty feet away, no matter how far Selenor and the heroes of Magnimar walk.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:09:05):
The garden contains plants that flower only in moonlight.

Trees whose leaves fall in perpetual autumn regardless of season, and grave-markers so ancient their names have worn to whispers.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:09:25):
This is no haunted cemetery.

The grounds are immaculately tended, the paths raked clean, the monuments polished. 

This is a place of completion, not decay.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:10:10):
Paths of white gravel wind between meditation alcoves where stone benches face open graves.

The graves are not empty, but waiting, reserved for those who have commissioned their resting places in advance. 

Some bear names. 

Some bear dates that are still in the future. 

Pre-planning one's funeral is considered spiritually responsible among Pharasma's faithful.

Anyone with Religion knows this.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:11:58):
At the garden's heart: a fountain. 

But instead of water, it pours sand.

The sand is made up of silver and blue grains cascading from a marble spiral into a basin that never fills.

They are constantly draining through hidden channels to begin the cycle again. 

Beside it stands a stone table and upon the table: the high mourner.

She lies on the table, in the tea party soul plague coma, the thick black-green infection visible across her face, having spread up from her stomach.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 06:12:39):
The Plague Doctor makes his way across the white gravel path to the fountain and stands next to the stone table.

The party follows.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 08:15:58):
Plague Doctor:
"Kethran Mournhollow of the Final Ledger."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 08:17:01):
Kethran Mournhollow of the Final Ledger:

"The High Mourner's soul is... contested. 

Something claims it. Something that should not exist. 

The plague is not merely disease.

It is a tether, pulling souls toward a seal or a bond, rather than the Boneyard."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 08:21:33):
Kethran Mournhollow of the Final Ledger:

"The Lady showed me a place. 
A book.
A prison. 

Your friend, a professor, is dead. 

You will complete what was left undone. 

It will not cure the High Mourner, but it will buy her time. 

Time enough for you to find the plague's true source.

Do you understand, Wanderer? 

The Lady does not ask. 

She informs."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-12 08:21:38):
Kethran Mournhollow of the Final Ledger awaits the party's reply.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-13 16:11:12):
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger is about to say something...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-13 22:45:52):
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger tilts his mask away from Selenor, as if not "looking" at him directly then says:

"Of all the servants of all the divines. 

The servants of Pharasma are some of the most directly spoken to, directly instructed and directly course-corrected when things drift too far awry.  

Still. 

Sometimes, some things are left. Strange. 

I know of what the High Mourner would divulge to you. 

I know not what the Lady of Graves feels of this divulgence in this very moment." 

The timepiece clicks 4 times then Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger continues:

"Such a secret would normally be met with attempts at great secrecy. 

Yet. 

The time approaches when the veil is lifted. 

Such attempts at secrecy will matter not. 

I think 3 things. 

1. The high Mourner will tell you her research. By then you will have earned it. 

2. Pharasma thinks if you investigate the death of your professor friend it will save the life of the High Mourner. 

3. This is your chance to rejoin the faithful, be welcomed back into these most holy places by your adopted mother D'Bear and take your place among the hierarchy of the faithful. 

You will have a choice to make, your soul, your allegiance may yet lie with Pharasma. 

Instead of being doomed for eternity...... "

**Kyno zyno | Taru'kara** (2026-01-14 10:55:06):
While the party is investigating the Temple of Pharasma, Taru'kara the rogue unbeknownst to the rest of the party would finally arrive in Sandpoint after taking the teleportation circle from Magnimar to Sandpoint. After stepping out of the circle she would take a moment to take in the fresh air, the new seaport smell, the sounds of the city, the people walking by, and so on.

"My oh myyy...so this is Sandpoint huh? Such a lovely city filled with a lively townsfolk and port, reminds me of Otari but a larger one...either way as much as I would love to peruse this place, I've got a party to find."

After taking in the moment, Taru'kara quickly got back to what she was here for, to join the "Heroes of Magnimar" and be a part of their grand journey. She would start by finding the nearest city guard and asking them where the party was last seen.

"Um..hello there, I hate to interrupt but do you know where the Heroes of Magnimar went? I am simply asking cause I would like a...autograph from them, Yes!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 23:40:47):
Kethran Mournhollow of the Final Ledger does not move.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 23:40:57):
Selenor's grey fire reflects in the dark glass of his mask's eye-holes.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 23:41:09):
The pale lights in his soul-staff drift around, slowly, as if watching Selenor.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 23:41:55):
When Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger speaks, Kethran's voice carries no offence. 

No defensiveness. 

Only the weight of something very old, observing something that is very tired.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 23:42:47):
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger:

"You misunderstand, Wanderer.

I am not the Lady.

I am not her priest.

I am not her faithful.

I am a psychopomp. 

A clerk. 

A shepherd of the dead.

I do not recruit souls. 

I do not bargain for them. 

I do not want them.

I ensure they reach where they must go. 

Nothing more."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 23:42:53):
The timepiece clicks three times.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 23:43:32):
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger:

"Your grievances with the divine are yours to carry.

I will not defend gods to mortals. 

That is not my function.

You asked how to save the High Mourner.

I will tell you what I know."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 23:43:50):
Kethran reaches into his robes and produces a folded letter.

The letter is sealed with black wax bearing the spiral of Pharasma.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 23:45:22):
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger:

"Professor Ionacu Lozar."

A pause.

Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger opens a black book, it opens to what seems like the right page, you get the feeling it always does this.

Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger traces his finger down the book, stops and says:

"You saw him last on the 31st of Arodus. 

Eleven days ago.

He is now dead.

His funeral will be held in Ravengro, a village in Ustalav.

You are named in his will."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 23:45:56):
@MrNegetZ 
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger looks at Allisee:

"As are you, dragon-blooded one."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 23:46:44):
@Mossssssssssssssssssssssssss 

Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger looks at Carnon:
"And you, demon of the pale, child of the deep black".

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 23:47:53):
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger:

"They wait for you. 

The professor's body has been preserved by a gentle-repose type ritual. 

Professor Lozar's water genie nature... Complicated the ritual, but it holds. 

For now.

However."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 23:48:35):
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger pauses, his train of thought distracted:
"There was mention of a bird man (@Askarans) and some others.
I assume they have left your company..."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 23:49:28):
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger continues:

"They will not wait forever.

If you delay too long, the funeral proceeds without you.

The will is read without you.

Whatever the professor left for you... passes to others.

Or to no one."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 23:49:36):
Kethran tilts his ceramic beak, as if considering something.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 23:51:55):
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger:

"The Lady's vision showed me fragments.

A place. 

A book. 

A woman, a tormented woman.

I do not know where my lady guides you.

But I suspect..."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 23:53:52):
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger pauses, then says:

"... When you learn it, it will feel like fate.

Given what you carry. 

Given what you seek.

The name will not be a coincidence.

There is no such thing as coincidence."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-17 00:01:38):
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger:

"There are rites that were never completed. 

I can FEEL it.

The dead that do not rest.

Looping endlessly. 

Forever reliving their final moments.

Unfinished deaths. 

Souls caught between.

Complete what was left undone. 

Release the trapped spirits to the Boneyard.

To the Lady of the Graves.

It will not cure the High Mourner. 

But it will weaken the tether. 

Buy her time."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-17 00:01:50):
Kethran's mask turns toward Vara's plague-ridden form on the stone table.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-17 00:02:24):
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger:

"You have done work for the Lady before, Wanderer.

Whether you intended to or not.

In the Gauntlight, you freed the soul of a goblin. 

Ensured its passage to the Boneyard when it would have been trapped forever.

The Lady noticed.

Pharasma does not forget those who do her work. Never.

Even those who do not wear her spiral..."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-17 00:02:32):
The timepiece clicks.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-17 00:03:47):
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger:

"If you complete this task... 

If you release the trapped souls and return the professor's unfinished work to the spiral...

The Lady will spend the influence she has gathered. 

Influence you helped gather.

Influence you will help gather.

Pharasma will reach into the High Mourner's soul and contest the tether directly.

It will not cure her... 

But it will wake her.

Weak. 

Perhaps bedridden for months.

But alive. 

Conscious. 

Able to speak."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-17 00:03:56):
Kethran turns back to Selenor.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-17 00:05:59):
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger seems hesitant and speaks the following very slowly. 

As if careful to not say too much or reveal an unspeakable truth:

"Able to tell you what she learned about the Lady's... older face.

Able to ask you, herself, if you will continue what she started all those years ago...."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-17 00:07:02):
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger:

"There is more work to be done, Wanderer. 

What awaits near Ravengro is only the beginning.

But that is for Vara to explain. 

If Vara wakes.

WHEN Vara wakes.

If you do this, that is."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-17 00:07:31):
A long pause. 

The sand-fountain whispers behind them.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-17 00:07:55):
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledge picks up some sand and lets it flow through his gloved fingers.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-17 00:09:27):
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger:

"As for what the Lady offers you personally..."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-17 00:09:31):
Kethran's voice shifts. 

Slightly less clinical. 

Almost... scared.

"That is between you and her.

But I will say this:

The Lady knows what you are becoming.

She knows what your grandfather wants you to become.

She believes there is... another path. 

A way to walk between life and death without belonging to either.

A way to be undying without being undead.

If you complete what she asks... all of it... she may show you that path.

Not as a slave.

Not as a servant.

As one who chooses."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-17 00:09:40):
The timepiece clicks five times in rapid succession.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-17 00:10:14):
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger:

"But that is far ahead.

For now: Ravengro. 

The professor's funeral. 

The place whose name you will learn.

You have weeks. 

Not months.

Do not waste them."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-17 00:10:48):
Kethran turns, starting to walk away, the white gravel crunching beneath robes that move without wind.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-17 00:11:41):
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger:

"You say you are nothing.

You say you are doomed.

Yet here you stand, demanding answers from servants of gods, swearing to burn Abaddon itself.

Nothing does not & cannot do that, Wanderer.

The doomed do not fight so hard."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-17 00:13:38):
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger pauses at the edge of the centre of the garden, right before the start of the path into another set of further doors:

"The High Mourner's study is in the east wing. 

Her notes remain. 

Her necklace remains.

You may examine them before you leave.

Or after you return.

Your choice."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-17 00:16:01):
And then, a telepathic message to Selenor.

Selenor, you hear a softer thought delivered to your mind, the voice of Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger sounds older and almost fatherly: 

"The Lady does not save souls, Wanderer.

Pharasma judges them. 

Pharasma guides them. 

Pharasma ensures they reach where they must go, their final destination.

But sometimes...

Sometimes Pharasma gives them the chance to save themselves.

This is your chance.

Save yourself, Selenor."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2026-01-17 00:19:26):
Selenor when he hears the death of the professor his fire burns out "I.... see
Thank you for doing your job for telling me this.
I will go to Ustalav and do my duty as his friend and solve the mystery of his death."
The psychopomp sees a lot of humble respect from Selenor

Selenor then ponders for a second and simply replies
There are ghouls under the city.
I have yet to find out their allegiance
How should I deal with them?
I would also like to inform or advince either you or whoever is in change of the defense of the cemetries across the city to bless them with anti-undead wards

As long as I exist on Golarion only I should be allowed to create void lifeforms or to give permission to create them.
The so called undead gods lost that priviliege after aligning themselves with the demons and daemons"

Selenor then bows thank you for your time Final Ledger
If you ever need help with something feel free to find me.
