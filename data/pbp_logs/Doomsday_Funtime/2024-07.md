## Session 216. 2024 July 13th Saturday + 4710 AR, 26th Arodus. + Junima rescue part 5.

Location: 
Black rock island, one of the indigo isles on the plane of Battlezoo. 

Selenor, Allisee and Cardigan have defeated 3 magic spiders.
Which unlocked a strange fiendish corpse and from this corpse has come a key to a locked door and a scroll for a ritual.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-07-15 15:29:57):
Selenor tries to understand the scroll

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-07-15 15:30:15):
and asks the fellow Oracle dude what the scroll says

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-07-15 16:00:02):
Well since Amar isn't there Alissee will try to decypher it with society:

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-07-19 03:09:53):
"Those "aeon stones" contain souls imbued wit sin magic. They might be the faithful"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-07-19 03:14:52):
"Then why I a seer of the dead can hear them scream or... (Selenor looks at the lust rune in disgust) moan?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-07-19 03:28:42):
" what if we combine them then?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-07-19 03:29:19):
"Instead of them being the sin runes we combine them into one big sin rune"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-07-19 03:30:31):
"Each rune is one aspect of magic"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-07-19 03:30:59):
"Just like Nethys we combine them in one magic the arcane"

Cardigan sits on the ground and pokes the corpse with her weapon.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-07-19 03:36:28):
"My creators are unknown to me"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-07-19 03:36:58):
"Kill and assimilate"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-19 03:38:49):
Welter:
"One spider hit to the head too many perhaps?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-07-19 03:39:22):
"This is my directive"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-07-19 03:45:59):
"We need a runelord"

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-07-19 03:48:15):
"Wait so it seems like a religious thing maybe Cardigan can help us! Do you know anything about ancient sin-religious practices Cardigan?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-19 03:50:08):
Cardigan practises dancing.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-07-19 03:51:17):
" I will also summon ice cream if you do it"

Allisee reads the ritual scroll.

This time knowing that her connection to the divine is what must be thought upon.

Allisee does not worship a particular deity, instead allowing her open connection to flow outwards.

Something in Allisee's blood stirs, growls and roars in Allisee's mind: the roar of a dragon.

Allisee, you have awakened something deep within yourself, and within this scroll.
You see the shards of sin glow, though Selenor does not seem to notice.

A beam of light leaps from the scroll, and before you stands this entity:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-19 04:18:19):
She has 7 feathered wings.

She says:

"A banner caller? There is no way, your line is long dead."

She looks curiously at you.

"No, you are something else."

She sees the scroll.

"With the rites of the previous incarnation."

She grabs you a powerful grip, lifting you into the air.
As you move from your previous position, your companions do not notice, as you look down, you see yourself standing 
where you were.

This must be happening only in your mind, or something like that...

"Do you know what you almost did? You nearly called the broken mistress HERE to the plane of hidden, her blood could 
be used to find..."

Her eyes go wide in surprise... and perhaps fear?

"A servant of the moon, a traitor of your blood. How dare you? Is this your feeble attempt to kill me? To kill the 
mistress?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-19 04:18:46):
Her hands start to crush you, she seems to perceive you as the enemy.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-07-19 05:02:50):
Alissee will try to recall knowledge/identify magic on Occultism to figure out exactly if what popped out of the scroll is an illusion.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-07-19 05:47:29):
"Wow your friends really got that moon goddess good, well done...." Alissee says sarcastically

"So for more information on the grandma ask Selenor the guy in heavy armor over there, i know she has 'green flame magic' is kind of a witch and is called Junima.

She got kidnapped, i blame Selenor and his gray flame father side or whatever, and from what you are telling me and what we know I'm guessing the people who did that are trying to maybe release that thing and it seems we both want that thing not released so how about a temporary truce?

Also i now have 6 questions don't think i'm not keeping score."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-19 06:51:21):
Tuds pauses for a moment, contemplating her response, maintaining her grip on your throat.
Tuds slowly lowers you to the ground:
> "The star-stone killed my goddess, same as yours.
> It is part of our sacred duty to prevent that thing from getting out, it would mean the end of days.
> I have a proposal.
> I will give you a holy ring, it will pass you off as a follower of Lissala, allowing you to read sin-speak and 
> many other benefits.
> However, in return, I will place within you, within your very soul: a slither of Lissala.
> This slither is a piece of runic magic, a seed of light."

Tuds raises her hand in floating in it, appears a sin-ring.
> "Take the ring, stop this threat, save the moon, save everything."

What do you do?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-07-19 07:21:06):
"Well it's fishy but it's not like i have a real choice i suppose... I'll take that deal IF you also answer my 5 more questions because i think it’s only fair i ask the same amount of questions you did.

What are those banner callers you mentioned?

How do you think i am related to them?

What’s your affiliation with the broken mistress that i suppose is the ghost in the lighthouse?
I am not using actual names intentionally so as to not accidentally provoke anything.

Why did Lassala and the Moon goddess fight each other?

And would it be possible to beat, seal or kill the companion of the creature that you talked about, the black jackal face thing?
