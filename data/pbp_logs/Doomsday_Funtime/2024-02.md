**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-02-16 08:03:35):
None of the guards seem like a threat to the group, some of the servants are still crying after Allisee's intimidation, and Zutlieg's song.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-16 11:15:01):
Selenor: "Mayor Menhemes, I realized the discomfort my actions have caused, and for that, I apologize. However, revealing my identity could incite more turmoil, not just for me, but for the innocent people in your community. Please let's work together to find a solution that will maintain the peace and order without risking further unrest in your community"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-16 11:19:02):
"The real enemy is Belcora and her god not us.You have my word, Mayor. I may have made mistakes, but I am willing to make amends and create some sort of trust . If you agree to keep my group  identity confidential and work with me to resolve this peacefully, I will do everything in my power to ensure the safety of your town from Belcora and giving Otari's soul proper rest and returning the body for burial."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-16 12:27:09):
Selenor tries to scan the mayor's motives

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-16 12:37:49):
Selenor: "Mayor Menhemes, I appreciate your willingness to cooperate, but I sense there may be more to this situation than meets the eye. I need your honesty  if we're to resolve this peacefully. Please, let's work together openly and address any issues that may be fueling this unrest. Trust goes both ways, and I'm counting on your sincerity to help us find a lasting solution. I know my form has caused you unrest otherwise I haven't tried to harm anyone here nor have I touched anything as you requested. You said you are one of the heroes descendants . What would have they done if they were informed that their dear friend Otari has been  trapped for more than hundreds of years, but also knowing that I could help him move on. I am an oracle that specializes in helping the dead and undead ."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-16 12:42:52):
"You are a cleric of Erastil so was your ancestor , for you these people are your familly and I respect that ,but for your ancestor so was Otari. If you imprison me it is likely he will forever remain trapped there and if you inform everyone of us what makes you think Belcora's allies won't come here once they hear about us?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-16 13:27:51):
Selenor scanning for motives

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-16 13:28:06):
/roll 1d20+19

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-16 14:14:50):
Selenor" Mayor....  Erastil is the god of nature, family and community . You said his name outloud and still you are not being honest with me..... what is it that makes you fear me so much? I only wish the best for everyone regardless of whatever they are good or not. What is it that torments your heart....?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-16 14:21:06):
"..... I too have a family I know how is like to be worried for their safety"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-16 14:22:59):
"You will doom us and yourself if you are going to do what I regret you might do."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-16 18:17:18):
Selenor casts augury and asks what the mayor does is Weal, Woe, Weal and Woe or Nothing.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-16 18:18:02):
I passed the dc 6 check

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-16 19:03:16):
Selenor turns to one of the guards and says "The augury predicted woe and weal. I think you should inform your mayor."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-16 19:09:27):
Selenor turns to the other guards " This is not good if you value your mayor and college lives let me investigate and join me for it."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-16 19:16:15):
"Your friend has not returned and he said something is foul  after I gave him the result of my augury weal and woe which means bad and good "

**None** (2024-02-16 19:20:43):
"Well Selenor, I think we should leave for now and let everyone just calm down.  I'm sure we can work this all out another time"  Zutlieg says to Selenor while hinting that he has something up his sleave and that Selenor should play along

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-16 22:33:03):
I cast Clairvoyance  in the kitchen hall

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-16 22:45:41):
where did the guard go?

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-16 22:45:48):
he said kitchen hall no?

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-17 02:06:37):
Dining hall then

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-17 10:10:14):
Selenor then casts scrying on the mayor

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-17 21:32:45):
failed

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-18 01:24:39):
"I don't know.... I am just as confused right now as a mindless shell. I exhausted all of my thinking processes. I require advice from an employer rank or above on how to approach the situation....."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-02-18 01:26:51):
Cardigan:
"Come here Selenor, it's soft, I promise!"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-02-18 01:31:42):
"Very well this shell shall go into sleep mode and update its edicts and anathemas as per the creators wishes while in this mode....  Be safe. "Selenor rests on her lap and in a blink of an eye he is "asleep".
