Amar Rookmoon is standing before a strange monstrous fish man.

**Rebecca DoomsdayFuntime** (2023-08-26 21:21:49):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2023-08-26 21:26:52):
This creature stands to almost its full height, standing up to almost 20 feet tall, its head touches the ceiling of the tunnel.
It extends his 6 powerful arms, each ending in variously shaped and sized claws and incisor shaped external bones.

From it's jaws trickles thick musculus slime.

It's underbelly is covered in long thing spikes, contrasted against the short thick rock-like spikes on its back.

It growls and swings at you.

**Rebecca DoomsdayFuntime** (2023-08-26 21:43:40):
Does anything happen to the water?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2023-08-26 21:47:11):
As a reminder you are in a strange throne room.

With a greatly worn, eroded throne in the centre of the room, surrounded by bones, scraps of metal, and pieces of dark broken stones.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2023-08-26 21:47:18):
The creature you are fighting appeared after you came near the throne, seemingly appearing from nowhere.

It immediately acted with intent to kill, a strange dulled intelligence behind the creature's eyes.

It seems almost like he is defending the throne.

**Rebecca DoomsdayFuntime** (2023-08-26 21:48:10):
Can I touch him and attempt the mind thing

**Rebecca DoomsdayFuntime** (2023-08-26 21:49:57):

**Rebecca DoomsdayFuntime** (2023-08-26 22:07:49):
That feels illegal to see

**Rebecca DoomsdayFuntime** (2023-08-26 22:08:10):
I close my eyes

**Path Wars** [GM] (2023-08-26 22:11:40):
@tinysliney 

Amar speaks words of arcane power, using her force of personality to invoke vaster math-magical calculations far beyond her mental faculty, then with a wave of her wet feathered arms Amar surges upwards into the air, coming face to face with the sea monster, as your eyes meet at eye level.

You come quickly surging downwards, your fist punching the ground evoking a ripple of conjured flaming stone.

With a burst of speed the sea monster turns his back to the flaming stone, the rocky shell means that most of the flaming stones bounce off harmlessly but some of the stones burn into the stone of the shell, causing the sea monster to let out a deep hollow moan of pain.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2023-08-26 22:13:10):
You may roll your rapier attack with the bonus damage from bespell weapon.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2023-08-26 22:14:09):
@tinysliney 

Attack roll screenshot please.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2023-08-26 22:14:12):
You need clumsy.

**Rebecca DoomsdayFuntime** (2023-08-26 22:17:33):

**Rebecca DoomsdayFuntime** (2023-08-26 22:24:52):
Shout out to Anthony

**Path Wars** [GM] (2023-08-26 22:30:18):
The strike cuts into the underbelly of the sea creature, as you sink your blade into his stomach you come closer to him, the smell of his body filling your nostrils.

He smells.... Fine.
Your brain tells you that he smells of salt, sea, fish, mucus, seaweed, etc but your body.... Likes it.
He smell is comforting instead of making you gag, which you know you should be.

His dark blue blood stains your rapier as you pull out your blade.

The sea monster takes this opportunity to use his reaction to attempt to stamp on the ground with great force creating a localised earthquake.

Roll a reflex save as you attempt to keep yourself upright against the force of the Earthquake.

I would like to move 35 more feet away :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2023-08-26 22:47:11):
The creature dives into the ground, liquifying upon hitting the ground.

... Silence for a few seconds ...

... A rumble of stone, a slight quake of the ground ...

Suddenly the sea monster shoots out of the ground, reappearing 15 feet away from Amar.

As part of this activity he unleashes a powerful upward strike.

Is there anyone going to TTFC next week. I still have like 2 room space available. So that we can just share the money and pay. 🥹 my plans later changed. I know this group isn’t meant for that thanks.
