**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 05:33:43):
During the 2 hours, Cardigan asks the ghoul Khamos if the prayer book can be sent down to Viole & Allisee.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 05:33:51):
Khamos agrees.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 05:33:56):
The book is sent down.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 05:34:46):
@Ltviolejuegrace 
@MrNegetZ 

A robed man leaves the admin building, hands you the book and says:
"The meeting has yet to conclude but they wish you the best of luck."

The robed man reenters the building.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 05:34:58):
The sand golems continue to guard the door.

**Tony Nelson = Moonlight = Pathfinder Lt. Viole Jule Grace** (2025-03-23 05:37:07):
Viole grabs Allisee and heads to the meeting area

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 05:39:59):
Viole reads the shruken prayer book with difficulty due to it's small size.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 05:40:25):
It is a prayer book of the Osirion pantheon, primarily Khepri.

Viole is an expert in religion.

You are aware that Khepri is the Osirian god of freedom, the rising sun, and work. 

He represents those who toil in ignominy and squalor, and is a trickster, turning the indignity of his appearance and labor upon those who consider themselves refined, elevated, and superior to others.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 05:41:25):
Viole reads the 2nd book.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 05:43:40):
The 2nd book is about the city of Wati.

Wati, also called the Half-City, is located in southern Osirion at the confluence of the Asp and Crook rivers and the birth of the River Sphinx. It is best known for its enormous necropolis, or city of the dead, a relic of a bygone plague.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 05:45:06):
The city is a city of Pharasma, one of the largest cities dedicated to her worship on Golarion.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 05:46:06):
The city of Wati is also known for its connection to the cults of Nethys.

These cults are dedicated to learning the workings of the unbinding spell.

A spell that can unbind the universe.... if it is real of course.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 05:46:17):
The books besides this don't seem special.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 05:48:19):
^ A picture in the book of Wati.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:05:32):
Allisee, Selenor and Viole go to a warehouse sided building at the far end of the university grounds.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:05:57):
The entrance of the warehouse is not guarded and is open, workers are flowing in and out.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:06:47):
@Ltviolejuegrace Do you enter the warehouse?

**Tony Nelson = Moonlight = Pathfinder Lt. Viole Jule Grace** (2025-03-23 06:07:27):
Yes

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:07:29):
The workers flowing in and out are carrying rope, bags and books.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:07:35):
You enter the warehouse.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:07:37):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:08:08):
A large golem, clearly not made here, is getting ready to carry all of the supplies on it's back.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:08:39):
Besides that a team of similarly dressed Osirion scholars are preparing themselves.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:08:50):
As far as you can tell the professor is not here yet.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:09:37):
An orc approaches you, his dark green skin a sign of his Osirion-orcish lineage:
"Oi! You lot. WOT you doin' standing around like that? Come on COME ON.
Wanna piss the twat off MORE!?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:09:47):
The orc looks to be a foreman.

**Tony Nelson = Moonlight = Pathfinder Lt. Viole Jule Grace** (2025-03-23 06:10:54):
I fall in step helping load supplies checking to see if I can find the professor's personal belongings

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:13:11):
The idea is that the golem is basically carrying a load of bags of holding, all tagged with what their contents are.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:13:45):
You are aware which bag of holding is the professor's as you learn what workers are doing what.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:14:19):
Though the work you are doing is more dedicated to moving the more general supplies from nearby store houses into organised piles closer to the bags of holding.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:14:54):
You also find out that the professor is very very particular.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:15:10):
Lozar will do final checks when he arrives, checking the contents of each bag of holding.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:18:04):
Each researcher will be carrying a personal backpack including Lozar.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:18:15):
Lozar's backpack is current with him, in class.

**Tony Nelson = Moonlight = Pathfinder Lt. Viole Jule Grace** (2025-03-23 06:30:05):
We intercept him on the way to the warehouse bumping into him knocking him over as we help up I hand him the books along with everything else that fell out of his bag

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:32:42):
OR where do you wait?

**Tony Nelson = Moonlight = Pathfinder Lt. Viole Jule Grace** (2025-03-23 06:34:23):
We act like workers who don't see him a bump into as he's coming into the warehouse

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:39:58):
Unexpectedly early, Professor Ionacu Lozar walks in.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:40:18):
A dwarf near the group says to another dwarf:
"I heard he cancelled his last class, eager to get on the way."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:45:06):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:45:50):
The professor seems annoyed as you walks across the warehouse:
"Are we ready? Are we ready?
The Pillar are NOT going to study themselves you know!!!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:46:06):
The orc foreman explains to him that we are nearly ready but that the professor is early.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:46:40):
The whole host of researchers are gathered around the professor, all looking eager to curry favour....and not to get onto his bad side.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:49:16):
The professor stops, is answering another researcher's question.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:49:34):
The professor creates an orb of water using very little to no hand signs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 06:49:51):
He seems like a very proficient user of water based magics.

**Tony Nelson = Moonlight = Pathfinder Lt. Viole Jule Grace** (2025-03-23 07:18:21):
Selenor bumps Lozar knocks him and the researcher's over causing a distraction as we help them up I hand him the unshrunken books along with his things

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:24:23):
Selenor bumps into the Professor pretending it was an accident.

**Tony Nelson = Moonlight = Pathfinder Lt. Viole Jule Grace** (2025-03-23 07:24:37):
*[image]* saying sorry for knocking them over

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:24:40):
Selenor: Performance & Athletics check.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:25:27):
Then Viole stealthily pulls out the book from his worker's clothing then lies to the professor.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:25:49):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:25:56):
Selenor fails to knock the professor over.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-23 07:26:46):
Use mine instead

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-23 07:26:58):
I didn't call for that reroll

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-23 07:27:11):
🙈

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:32:47):
*[image]*

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-23 07:33:11):
Alissee being useless as per usual

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:33:13):
Allisee "tries" to shove over the professor subtly using a crate.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:33:29):
*[image]* Critical failure trip.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:33:33):
Allisee falls prone.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:34:10):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:34:40):
Viole rushes up, leaping over the on-the-ground Allisee, grabs the crate from Selenor and "slips" into the professor, knocking him down.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:35:06):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:36:58):
Viole VERY subtly takes the book from Viole's crate.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:37:02):
Critical success.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:37:14):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:37:44):
Viole almost critically fails to slip the book into his backpack.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:38:07):
The professor Lozar is CONFUSED.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:38:12):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:38:14):
What do you say?

**Tony Nelson = Moonlight = Pathfinder Lt. Viole Jule Grace** (2025-03-23 07:38:55):
I'm so sorry I'm sorry we'll get everything ready as fast as possible no more mistakes so sorry

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:38:58):
Professor Ionacu Lozar stands up and gets angry:
"What in the circus is this?
I thought you were meant to be putting my belongings together, not taking them apart!!!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:40:18):
Professor Ionacu Lozar uses water he conjures from his hands to wipe everyone down.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:40:31):
Professor Ionacu Lozar says to you Viole:
"Are you joining us on our expedition?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:40:38):
Viole.

Roll me a perception check.

**Tony Nelson = Moonlight = Pathfinder Lt. Viole Jule Grace** (2025-03-23 07:41:36):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:42:20):
*[image]* With a 30 in perception, you see this is tucked below Professor Ionacu Lozar's shirt, almost out of sight.

You knocking Professor Ionacu Lozar over, lodged it up a bit.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:44:14):
Professor Ionacu Lozar will quickly get bored of this interaction and go over to the golem to perform final checks.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:44:29):
He does not check his backpack due to being surrounded by questions and queries from the crowd.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:44:32):
Do you leave?

**Tony Nelson = Moonlight = Pathfinder Lt. Viole Jule Grace** (2025-03-23 07:47:54):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:48:16):
With a 35 trained-society roll to recognise the scarab, you will recall two pieces of information.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:48:49):
1. It is the necklace that is not well knowingly worn by members of an organisation of which you do not know the name of.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:48:57):
2. Keleri wears this necklace everyday.

**Tony Nelson = Moonlight = Pathfinder Lt. Viole Jule Grace** (2025-03-23 07:50:21):
We leave while no one is watching us

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:51:03):
Do you leave the university grounds?

**Tony Nelson = Moonlight = Pathfinder Lt. Viole Jule Grace** (2025-03-23 07:51:50):
We head back to the administration building to wait for Carnon

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-23 07:54:09):
3/4 objectives complete.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-23 14:59:38):
I had a better roll

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-23 21:32:21):
*[image]* Checks for the 1rst and 2nds.
Total cost should be 8gp of material for the first and 1 gp for the second since both are treated as crits.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-24 01:58:25):
You have learnt these spells.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-24 01:58:29):
What happens next? :)

**Gus Choi** (2025-03-27 14:35:58):
In the stillness of the night, a lone room flickered with a soft glow. Within its walls, Kaito pored over a complex web of relationships and intelligence, his mind consumed by the intricate details. His secret room in Eto was a hub of research, where he meticulously studied the inner workings of the brothel, from its personnel structure to security protocols and the owner's connections. As he pondered, his fingers absently stroked his chin, his thoughts lingering on the question, "What crucial piece of information am I still missing?"

**Gus Choi** (2025-03-27 14:38:40):
(What information he think he is still missing to know the secret, or steal the secret if it is stealable, or to prepare to steal?)

**Gus Choi** (2025-03-27 18:16:28):
As the hour draws near, Kaito readies himself for his shift at the brothel. He alters his appearance, donning a disguise. With a question foremost in his mind, he makes his way to the brothel. During his shift, his eyes scanning the surroundings as he wonders if he'll be able to uncover any clues that might have been overlooked - information that could prove crucial to the success of his plan.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 04:23:55):
@Ltviolejuegrace 

Viole canonically knows quite a bit about brothel pricing.

Ah the life of a soldier.

**Tony Nelson = Moonlight = Pathfinder Lt. Viole Jule Grace** (2025-03-30 04:41:12):
I share this with the whole party

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 04:42:56):
What is the party's reaction to Viole explaining brothel pricing in such intimidate detail?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 04:43:07):
Cardigan looks excited.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 05:00:25):
Viole shows Cardigan a holy symbol of an Ibis.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 05:01:09):
Cardigan:
"That's Thoth.

Thoth was a member of the pantheon often worshiped in Ancient Osirion. 

He oversaw the moon, magic, and other erudite pursuits, including science, history, and philosophy. 

According to tradition, Thoth gave Osirian hieroglyphs to the ancient Osirians and was the scribe to the Osirian pantheon, recording all events in the lives of mortals."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 05:01:28):
Cardigan continues:
"Thoth encouraged his followers to spread order and knowledge and to record events big and small, and to avoid disrupting stable systems. 
He also demanded that followers correct incorrect knowledge."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 05:02:11):
Cardigan says:
"Much mystery surrounds the Ancient Osirion pantheon.

They are just so weird."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 05:02:26):
Cardigan smiles, zoning out.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 07:51:59):
Next? :)

**Gus Choi** (2025-03-30 10:57:43):
(If the brothel is called dancing dune, then yes. Unless there are anything happen on his way to the brothel)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 11:00:35):
Ok so you are there.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 11:00:41):
Doing your security shift.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 11:00:44):
What are you doing?

(How is the security shift? Is there any pre-set routine on the shift? Each person walk around randomly solely? Or are there any specific settings?)

Initially, Kage conducts a thorough reconnaissance of the brothel to familiarize himself with its layout. He meticulously notes the location of every room, their contents, and the corridors and passageways that connect them, verifying that this information aligns with the floorplan he has access to in his accommodations. Assuming he has prior knowledge of the brothel's floorplan and the functions of each area, this exercise serves as a refresher.

During his patrol, Kage also makes a point to gather intelligence on the security personnel, committing their faces and brief personal details to memory. This is crucial, as their patrol routines may overlap, and recognizing them could prove essential. Furthermore, he takes note of the shift schedules, understanding the timing of his own shift and how it intersects with others.

(Please kindly provide these information if available, and so Kage can plan what to do next)
