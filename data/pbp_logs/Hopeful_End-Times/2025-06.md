"I believe we should head back to the southern passage and make sure we leave no threats behind us and make sure the civilians remain safe on this level." (unless Chua believes that the ritual happening below needs to be stopped immediately would there be a roll for that?)\

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-06-05 18:50:48):
(I will try to role later today was on df so couldnt yesterday)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-07 21:00:46):
What next? :)

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-06-07 21:53:12):
Rolling sense motive to determine if the ritual needs to be stopped immediately....and Occultism to see if I know anything about what they are trying to do.

But it definitely invoking dark magic.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-06-08 04:40:42):
Chua being logical about things. would want to head back and check the southern way from the last fight.  "Hey, what's happening down there may be causing all the weirdness that has affected this place.  I recommend we finish searching the rest of the floor before confronting them and disrupting the ritual.  We might learn something that may help us stop that ritual."

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-06-08 05:15:13):
Lysae nods. “Knowledge is power. Are you sure we have the time though?”

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-06-08 15:47:58):
"I believe so.  They seemed unaware of us on the periphery so they should have no reason to speed up."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-10 04:45:43):
Now what? :)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-06-10 18:22:12):
Livy pipes up
"I think we should go meet them. Maybe they're ★FANS★!"

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-06-11 15:58:06):
Chua places his long fingers at the center of his forehead and sighs.  "But you want to miss any other fans on the floor we first arrived on.  Think how disappointed they would be."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-17 11:06:29):
What next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-18 12:42:33):
We are not in encounter mode.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-22 16:36:10):
What next? :)

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-06-23 02:21:12):
Sorry I will bow to liv and we go down to the cultist.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-23 19:46:30):
What next? :)

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-06-24 02:36:37):
Yes we go down into the death trap.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-28 00:24:49):
The group goes down the ladder.

**Wafflemuncher** (2025-06-29 23:53:17):
Before the group can descend the ladder a bright purple and green light fills the space behind them. It swirls gaining in speed and size until it's large enough for a humanoid figure to fit through, which one does. Floating through the portal they would see what appears to be a humanoid brain with a billowing cloak underneath it emerge into the hallway and the portal closing rapidly behind it disappearing completely.

This creature does not have a face to easily read its nonverbal communication but the mannerism it takes with quick turns and rotations could reasonably be deduced as disorientation. A few tense moments pass before it telepathically communicates with the party in front of it.

"I hope it's good to meet you all, I am known as Arcanamirium Occult Campus. Do you know where I am?"

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-06-30 16:56:48):
A agile ysokai turns to look at you, he has multiple vials attched to his bandoleer and does not appear to be carrying a weapon.  "Salutations.  I am Chua Datafang.  The universe has decided to deposit you in the bowels of a spacestation where it appears a bunch of cultists are attemting to summon some extraspatial entity.  That is the current situation you find yourself in."

**Wafflemuncher** (2025-06-30 22:10:01):
The brain takes a moment to absorb this information before responding. "Then it is well to meet you Chua Datafang, I am not a warrior by trade but if you would allow me to I would like to travel with your party."
