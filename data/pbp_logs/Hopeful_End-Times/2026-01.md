**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-01-01 23:42:31):
Chua looks away from the calcifying former party members as well the cats come out of the woodwork.  His warp field extends immediately out from him as math formulae appears and disappears around everything in the field quickly calculating the dimensional variance around them.  "Well Mannee I think the Universe is providing again for us."  The small white furred Ysokai in a maintenance tech overalls looks over to the new arrivals and speaks in Pahtra to them. "So, you heard the scream, and maybe fell through the cracks of one universe to end up hear?  You suddenly find you have more skills then you had before almost as if you lived 2 similar lifetimes but just trained differently?  Well, it's good that you arrived suddenly as it seems I am in need of a crew who is willing to check out the local smuggler's landing pads and seek out a contact who has gone missing.  So either your hear to enjoy dumplings or get a job.  Both can be provided  here.  And since I realize I did not mention it.  My name is Chua Datafang, a hacker, pilot, mechanic among a few other roles I have taken on."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-02 02:20:20):
Miyuu stopped moving entirely and his fur flickers for a few seconds as he ponders what the Ysoki has said. Eventually it fans a neon green before he says, "Got me dead to rights... I'm here for some dumplings!"

**Brant Johnson** (2026-01-02 14:11:59):
Bones stands up and steps forward. "Believe it or not I don't know the the colorful one, but dumplings and a job sounds really good." Nods at miyuu.

**Brant Johnson** (2026-01-02 18:01:47):
"actually if I could get some clarity on the dumpling situation. Like are the dumplings included with accepting a job? If I order dumplings does a job come with it? Are the two things like separate? It wasn't super clear to me how that whole thing was workin.... But also like if the dumplings were included with the job that would be sweet...."

He goes a little bit eyed with embarrassment.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-02 18:28:21):
Miyuu glances between Bones and the Chua, his fur shifting colors before he rests his eyes back on Chua and Mannee. 

"I don't know him. Unless you are looking to charge someone for damages, then I do know him, and it was his idea. We will be happy to work it off." 

He slowly takes a seat. "Oh, and I'm Kit." He lies.

**Brant Johnson** (2026-01-02 19:07:50):
Bones looks startled. "Oh yeah names. My name is Bones."
He takes a long look at Miyuu take a breath as if to say something, stops and restarts. "Did I agree to something? I don't remember making a plan?"

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-01-02 19:16:40):
Chua shakes his head and snorts to himself. He calls to the kitchen, "Manee could you put out bowls for everyone?" Then addresses the new arrivals. "None of you have made any plans as of yet.  Except to eat dumplings.  However,  the universes has voluntold you to be here now.  So there is a job that needs doing.  A person to rescue and creds to be made. Once Manee @PathWars returns they can make their offer again and you can ask your questions."  He then moves over to the hole that 'Kit' fell through and servo arms pop off his back to begin patching the ceiling.

**Brant Johnson** (2026-01-02 22:02:21):
"that all sounds right to me." Bones starts helping with the patching.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-02 22:38:03):
Miyuu, still sitting, observes the two patching the ceiling. His fur waves through various neon colors as he hums to himself. Eventually, he allows his eyes to wander about, taking in the scenery of the shop. 

"How's those dumplings coming along!?" He shouts out to Mannee. "Been ages since I ate something that didn't get precooked in a can." He mutters to himself.

**Brant Johnson** (2026-01-03 01:00:27):
Bones seems to get distracted from the labor and walks towards Miyuu's table. 

He awkwardly stands a few feet away. While looking at the ceiling (really trying not to make eye contact) he says "Uh hey Kit. I haven't seen another Pahtra in a really long time.. Did you hear a loud scream in your head that said to come here too?"

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-03 03:37:20):
"Hmm..." once again, Miyuu's fur flickers in various hurs and colors while he thinks. He honestly can't recall the reason why he ended up here, but he definitely remembered that loud shrill in his head.

"Well, I do recall a screeching noise a while back." He eventually responds, his fur no longer flickering, but instead pulsating, it's coloration changing each time. "But I was living in the crawlspace above for a few weeks now while investigating a personal matter." Maybe the shrill drew him here without his knowing. It didn't sit well with him, though, to think there might be something playing him like some piece on a board. 

He scans Bones up and down, measuring him up a bit in his head.

**Brant Johnson** (2026-01-03 04:43:13):
"do you think the thing talking in our heads is related to both of us being Pahtra?

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-03 04:57:38):
"Doesn't seem like it. Chua made it seem like he heard it as well." Miyuu simply replies.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-01-03 05:43:20):
In Pahtra, Chua speaks up "Naw I don't think that's it.  You could have said it was because we all had tails. Which is also not a common factor with those who I met up with after that strange event." Switching back to common.  "There may be something special about each of us, or we all seem to be drawn together just because or the infinite randomness in the universe spat this situation out.  We all heard the scream, for some it awakened things within us, for others it changed them in other ways.  But something was born from it.  What I do not know."

**Brant Johnson** (2026-01-03 06:22:58):
"huh. Well it sounds over my ears... I'll enjoy the dumplings while we wait for the job to start I guess. My talents are not in big thinking... Like why universal sized things happen. I'm better with putting holes in things."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-03 06:28:47):
"Well, we might be a good fit, because I'm pretty good a putting things in holes." Miyuu begins to laugh at his own joke, and the coloration his fur begins to burst as if it fireworks in the night sky.

**Brant Johnson** (2026-01-03 06:52:49):
Bones lets out a snort "I see what you did there. Not too bad. I am just happy to have a place that it seems I belong for now."

For a fraction of a second, the air inside the shop bent inward, like breath being drawn into a lung that didn’t exist. A faint harmonic whine—half machine, half spell—cut through the clatter of bowls and casual banter.

Then something arrived.

A compact humanoid figure stumbled forward out of nothing and caught herself on one knee, fingers digging into the floor as if checking whether it was real. Her armor was scorched and mismatched, industrial plating over flexible synthweave, runes along the seams dimming and fading as residual energy bled away.

Steam curled around her.

Not weapons fire.
Not alarms.
Food.

She looked up slowly.

White hair, shoulder-length and tied back with practiced efficiency. Pale synthetic skin. One green eye, one blue, both scanning the room with unsettling precision—counting exits, distances, threats that weren’t there.

Her posture relaxed by exactly three degrees.

“…This is not a containment chamber,” she said quietly, more to herself than anyone else.

A beat.

Her gaze landed on the table. On the bowls being set out. On the smell—rich, unfamiliar, warm.

She straightened fully now, hands deliberately open and away from her sides.

“I followed a… signal,” she continued, head tilting slightly as if listening to something only she could hear. “A vocalization. High intensity. Non-local.” Another pause. “It appears to have ended here.”

Her eyes flick briefly to Miyuu’s shifting fur. To Bones. To Chua and the patched ceiling.

“…Are these,” she asks, voice soft but oddly formal, “dumplings?”

If anyone is close enough, they might notice her shoulders ease—just a little—at the confirmation that no one is trying to dissect her.

“My name is Alita,” she adds after a moment. “I don’t believe I’m being hunted right now. If that changes, I will inform you.”

She hesitates, then—almost experimentally—takes a seat.

“And if there is work,” she says, glancing at Chua, “I am very good at solving problems that involve things breaking.”

Her eyes return to the food.

“I would also like to try the dumplings.”

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-04 04:09:13):
Miyuu's fur brightens and shifts various shades of red and purple rapidly in a haphazard pattern at the arrival of Alita. As his heart rate slows, so does the shifting of colors, the brightness also dimming. His claws, which had anchored him in place during the surprise entrance, slowly retract.

What the hell is happening? Is all Miyuu can think. The whole scene over the last fifteen minutes or so is far beyond what any reasonable person would call 'normal'.

It takes a more than a handful of seconds before he finds himself able to respond. "The name is," he pauses for the briefest of moments, barely catching himself, "Kit."

"So... uh... you from around here?" He asks.

**Dmytro Laktyushkin dmitri_l | Ali4a** (2026-01-04 12:15:31):
Alita takes a pause as she tries to figure out her location using data available on the local networks.

After a couple seconds of concentration she turns to Kit.

"Good to meet you. I've failed to find any positional references I am aware of so probably not."

**Brant Johnson** (2026-01-04 16:55:17):
Bones slides the plate of dumplings forward on the table. "You can have some."

He looks stunned and confused.

**Dmytro Laktyushkin dmitri_l | Ali4a** (2026-01-04 18:17:26):
"Thank you" Alita then sits to join the group her armor still smoking "I will make sure to repay this favor" she says as she holds the bowl of dumplings as if something precious.

**Brant Johnson** (2026-01-04 20:12:41):
"you are welcome. You don't owe me anything I didn't pay for them." Bones can't help but make a confused and amused face.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-01-05 03:00:29):
Chua retracts his tools as he finished patching the ceiling before moving back to the new form group.  "So to make sure I have everyone's name straight we have: Alita, Kit, and Bones."  He said as he points to each in turn then pulls out a stool to sit at the same table. 

"Alright so to recap the mission that Manee offered was that they have a shipment coming into the lower docks it is either here already or will be arriving soon. They advised that the lower docks are complicated, must of them are just jammed with space junk except for the smuggler's dock.  Dock 3.  There are 2 individuals that we may need to make contact with or find who may help us locate Manee's shipment.  Spicey Sweet a smuggler amd another Shobad called Tego.  Manee has not heard anything recent from Spicey so is concerned he may be unwillingly detained or worse. So that's the request. Any questions direct them at Manee.  Otherwise we may need to move out soon."

However I do need to find a munitions dealer so I can try to get an Aeon rifle."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-05 03:44:26):
"Sounds good, chief." Miyuu responds as he slurps down another dumpling, his coloration staying steady at a soft neon blue. 

"You think you can find one on the way?"

**Brant Johnson** (2026-01-05 14:11:47):
Bones nods "you got my name right. I think I'm ready to go whenever you all are." Looks at at Alita. "The dumplings don't work as a walk and eat food very well. You can finish those if you want, but don't worry, if you want more later they were free." He smiles reassuringly.

**Dmytro Laktyushkin dmitri_l | Ali4a** (2026-01-05 19:02:28):
Alita seems torn between hurrying and enjoying the meal eventually settling on a middle ground. "I am finished. I would like to join you on the mission. My understanding is this is a way to legally acquire credits?"

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-01-05 19:11:20):
Chua smirks.  "Well it may not exactly be legal.  We are not official employees on a company's payroll.  However doing these odd jobs are how you can earn credits without paying taxes."

**Brant Johnson** (2026-01-05 21:37:20):
"that's my favorite way to be paid!"

**Dmytro Laktyushkin dmitri_l | Ali4a** (2026-01-05 22:17:03):
"Taxes, govenment id.. traceable. Yes, avoiding that is optimal."

**Brant Johnson** (2026-01-06 01:13:24):
Nods solemnly. "The government knowing who you are is generally bad." There is a several second pause and then Bones looks around with some guilt on his face and leans in to the table. "At least that's my opinion."

**Dmytro Laktyushkin dmitri_l | Ali4a** (2026-01-07 16:40:20):
"Are we waiting for something? Otherwise, we should first acquire equipment for Chua, before searching for Spicey Sweet or Tego"

**Brant Johnson** (2026-01-07 17:42:23):
Bones shrugs. "I'm ready. I'm not sure who is leading or if we just go?"

**Dmytro Laktyushkin dmitri_l | Ali4a** (2026-01-09 21:26:25):
Alita looks up the directions on the local network and leads the way.

**Brant Johnson** (2026-01-10 01:44:33):
Bones shrugs looks around the room and quickly follows Alita. He says (to no one in particular) "she made quite the entrance. And takes charge immediately! This might be fun."

**Brant Johnson** (2026-01-12 20:43:33):
Bones lays down and closes his eyes.

**Brant Johnson** (2026-01-17 21:10:49):
Rolls over in his sleep. 💤 

Back legs kick a bit

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:01:01):
His back legs kick once more in sleep, chasing something through dreams.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:07:12):
Manee Moonpuncher glances at Bones with a look of concern as Manee dishes out fresh bowls of dumplings, this time with ramen and miso soup.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:08:16):
Manee Moonpuncher looks at Bones again. And stares at him.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:11:49):
Manee Moonpuncher suddenly tries to grab Bones but as Manee darts her hand forward, a portal appears below the cat-man.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:12:05):
And Bones falls through, the portal immediately engulfing him.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:34:12):
The portal is/was green.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:34:14):
But...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:34:24):
For a fraction of a second, the portal flickers—green flame wrestling with something else, something that pulls the destination sideways.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:34:28):
The portal snaps shut with a sound like breaking glass.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:34:37):
The psychic echo of the Scream ripples through the space where Bones had been.
Quite. A whisper.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:34:59):
Manee Moonpuncher stares at the empty floor.

Manee's four arms hang at her sides:

"...I really need to stop serving people who fall asleep in my shop."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:45:29):
Manee Moonpuncher sighs, sits with the group and reiterates the job offer to the group.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:48:44):
*[empty message]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:48:51):
IF the group accepts.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:48:57):
Do you go to the local arms dealer?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:49:08):
It's called Castle Counting.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 14:31:42):
It's nearby.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-26 17:39:54):
Thats what it sounds like.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 17:41:39):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 17:41:53):
So... 4 players (the minimum) have voted.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 17:42:01):
The group accept the mission.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 17:42:19):
And make their way to the Castle Counting arms dealer shop.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 17:42:57):
Before I transition us to the arms dealer.

Does @MrNegetZ want to ask more questions or something?
