**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-04-01 00:09:32):
Suddenly, there seems to be a ripple in space, and suddenly appearing is, landing upside down, a ratfolk with calico fur pattern, mainly white with the occasional black and orange spots. 
His clothing is reminiscent of that what Absalom Pilots wear. 
As that ratfolk, who honestly looks more like a mouse in terms of physique, appears, he immediately turns pale and vomits, which spins him around. 
"Ugh... Fuck.. whatever that was.... I... hope that never happens... again..."

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-04-01 00:24:15):
A large-caliber projectile rifle looms ominously in the corner of the newly-arrived ysoki's eye, held in the hands of a slender fetchling woman in red and gold armor. "Oh great, another one," she mutters.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-04-01 00:37:09):
The ysoki flicks his tail and rights himself again. Gently he nudges the rifle out of his face with the back of his palm and wipes his mouth with the other. 
"Woah there.." the Ysoki said with a notable accent (think a thick German accent). 
"I don't know what just happened.. and whatever business you have down here.. I haven't seen anything alright?"
The ysoki's tail twitches nervously.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-04-01 01:38:11):
"Well Clank.  He's not hostile.  Greetings btother.  Welcome to this group of warp tossed party.  I am Chua Datafang. What should we call you." Says the white Ysokai also in pilot gear.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-04-01 01:43:35):
The Ysoki takes a deep breath and takes a step back, careful not to step onto the puddle of vomit on the ground. 
"Mausbert Gouda is my name." he says with a voice still shaking, whether out of nervousness, or because he just lost his lunch. 
"What do you mean with.. 'warptossed' party?"

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-04-01 01:54:21):
"He means that you're the fourth person we've seen appear out of nowhere in the last half-hour," the fetchling says as she removes the rifle from his face. "Lysae," she introduces herself. "Short version - we're all trapped down here right now, all sorts of things are attacking us as they rant about some kind of 'birth,' and we can discuss the rest once we're out of the bowels of Absalom Station and into more civilized areas. We need to keep moving."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-04-02 10:25:13):
"Guess so." Mausbert says, sighing with resignation.
"Where down here have you been already?" 
While asking that, Mausbert looks around towards other passageways.

**Jayson Jolin** (2025-04-03 18:25:56):
"I wonder if this station is suspended in some kind of nexus point.  It would explain the convergence of so many random pop-up people, myself included."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-04-03 18:54:12):
If we continue walking forwards, Mausbert follows. "Did you feel strange after that scream as well?"

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-04-03 19:29:12):
Lysae pauses. “Strange how?” she asks carefully.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-04-03 21:48:05):
"I don't care if you believe me if I say I'm not on flayleaf, but after the scream I felt like I could touch space itself.. pull on it."
Mausbert scritches the back of his head, knowing how ridiculous that sounds.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-04-03 22:37:56):
"No... perhaps not so strange," Lysae says softly.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-04-03 22:42:48):
"For me it does not. By being a living paradox I understand that sense of being able to manipulatate space. Some of us are born or created by this or other universes with the ability to warp reality.  So you are not weird Mausbert."

**Billy Helps CosmosOfTheEndless** (2025-04-04 00:23:15):
“I mean I can warp reality too……it’s just killing me to have the ability to do so.”

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-04-04 14:32:24):
"Perhaps you are doing something wrong.  With the ability to change our realities we should be able to avoid killing our selves."

**Billy Helps CosmosOfTheEndless** (2025-04-04 19:55:15):
“No no, it’s my….condition.”

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-04-05 14:21:18):
"Well you will still have a chance to rewrite that as well. " To the entire group. "So shall we move forward now?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-05 15:01:35):
"Ok"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-04-05 17:42:13):
Mausbert follows along, if possible being more in the middle of the pack.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-05 22:42:08):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-05 22:42:14):
The loot is still here to be taken.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-05 22:42:29):
There are two western doors.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-05 22:42:35):
Which door does the group open?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-05 22:42:45):
As the group walks past the gremlin puddle.

**Jayson Jolin** (2025-04-06 00:20:32):
Clank will grab the loot (as soon as we can get back into the Forge and someone tells me where to find the chest out there).  After that he will take a spot at the back of the line and Search (will roll once we're back on Forge).

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-04-06 00:21:10):
(I cant coordinate with path to be online at the same time, was taking the holograms even asked just have him move it to me.)

**Jayson Jolin** (2025-04-06 00:23:21):
(That's fine.  You can take them).

**Jayson Jolin** (2025-04-07 14:39:47):
*[image]* (Search activity roll)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-04-07 14:57:31):
*[image]* Mausbert gets closer to the nearest western door to listen for sounds behind it.

**Jayson Jolin** (2025-04-10 01:24:00):
"Those sparks look suspicious.  I'm somewhat handy; want me to try to figure that out while you check the other door, Mausbert?"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-04-10 03:20:49):
*[image]* "I'm also versed in fixing things. But sure, you take care of this door, I go for the other."
With that, Mausbert goes to check the other door.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-04-10 08:39:44):
Livy is going to check if the energy sparks means the door is going to close on people like the other one.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-04-10 18:38:13):
"If either of you need assistance just shout out."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-13 20:16:11):
The door seems to also be cursed as well.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-17 18:05:02):
You do however discover this is a trained task, so a DC of less than 20.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-04-17 18:06:41):
"It seems my ★Super Idol Hacking★ can't get through this door. They must have Nord VPN premium!"

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-04-17 18:52:48):
"Or you might let a datafang try."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-04-17 18:54:08):
"Let me give it a try." Mausbert says and walks up towards the door, trying to get it to open.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-04-17 18:55:44):
*[image]*

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-04-17 19:00:07):
*[image]*

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-04-17 19:00:09):
"Go ahead,  the encryption is going to take longer than I thought to crack."  He attempted to access it but failed

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-04-17 19:00:52):
"That door is quite stubborn as well." Mausbert sighs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-17 21:16:35):
The door is jammed open.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-17 21:17:06):
It tries to open and close like those super market motion detection doors but only moves back and forth a few centimetres with a repetitive motorised sound.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 00:46:50):
The door is open.

Do you proceed?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 00:48:06):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 00:48:07):
Now what?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 00:49:07):
It looks like it.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-04-18 00:50:48):
Mausbert sneaks as he steps  inside.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-04-18 00:51:21):
*[image]* (welp)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 04:51:12):
The door is barricaded.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 04:51:54):
There are hushed, fearful whispers can be heard within.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-04-18 13:50:43):
*[image]*

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-04-18 21:48:25):
"Looks like we might have to talk first.  Liv think you can to see if they are Fans of yours?"

**Billy Helps CosmosOfTheEndless** (2025-04-18 23:33:19):
“We could do with convincing them we’re not a threat. They sound scared.”

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-04-19 00:47:13):
“Negotiations would seem to be in order here. I’ll cover the rear if anything attempts to sneak up on us while you’re doing that.”

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-19 22:22:21):
Ok so who approaches the door? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-19 22:27:46):
*[image]*

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-04-20 20:37:44):
The creature behind would certainly percieve a rodent smell among others of course. And a hint of cheese.
"We just kinda got down here. Do you know another way up?"
His tone turns a bit somber. "What do you mean you loose too many friends?"

**Billy Helps CosmosOfTheEndless** (2025-04-20 23:50:29):
“None of us are holograms, as far as I know. We can help you out.”

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-04-29 17:00:46):
@PathWars ((is there any response or skill rolls needed so we can move forward?))

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-04-29 20:01:17):
"Stitch there is no need for blasting.  Perhaps you could tell us what dangers you encountered?  We have dealt with a few already."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-30 05:13:31):
After a few intense minutes of muffled conversation the door opens and you see a few dozen injured and scared tourists.

One robot investigator and a skittermander tour guide with a big cannon sized blaster.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-30 05:14:50):
The robot says:
"We have agreed.
We will give you tips and tricks on how to spot dangers here in the ghost levels and in return, if you get us out of here then we will pay you with this"

The robot resents a credit stick and says:
"400 credits. How does that sound?"

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-04-30 21:39:03):
"That seems to be a logical request.  We all have a common goal of returning topside. Since you have found a secure berth we can coordinate from here.  If you can detail what areas you have already encountered."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-30 22:25:55):
For the remainder of this dungeon you all have +1 to perception.
