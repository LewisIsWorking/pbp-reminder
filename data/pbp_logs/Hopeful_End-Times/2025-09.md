**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-09-01 00:32:31):
"Right we were advised not to head there without the recommendation of Manee.  I agree with you Mausbert.  Having worked on my parents trade ship for several years, the shipyards do sound like the best use for our talents."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-03 12:19:13):
What next? :0

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-03 13:45:19):
"Yeah, let's go."

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-09-03 16:19:16):
I concur. ::He activates his comm and begins to run a data search on this bodega for location, services and info on the owners.::

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-09-03 16:28:52):
Though his search takes him deep down into click bate spam.  Forcing him to do a system reboot and restore on his com.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:42:30):
A hardlight curtain shimmers in a crumbling stone archway, creating a fragile barrier between a noisy street corner and the scene within. Beyond it, the room has the atmosphere of a sun-baked desert temple, with worn stone walls and the illusion of natural light. But this ancient architecture is crammed with modern chaos: disordered shelves and bins overflow with brightly wrapped snack packages, colorful bottles, and all sorts of sundry goods.

Draped over the contents of a fruit display, a glossy gray squox basks in the artificial sunlight, its small body radiating contentment. At the opposite end of the tiny room, a reinforced glass booth faces the door. Inside, a towering figure in flowing silk garments and glittering jewelry busies herself with some unseen task.

Shelves behind the counter are a mix of practical and peculiar. You see medpatches and ammunition next to what look like dusty occult curiosities. A pleasant aroma of spices and fried dough hangs in the air, hinting at something delicious being prepared nearby.

This place feels like a warm, chaotic bubble of home in the middle of a bustling, indifferent station. It invites you to step inside and find out more about the person who created it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:43:17):
She is stands 12 feet tall, weighs around 500 pounds, most of which is muscle and their skin is grey.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:43:19):
4 arms.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:43:36):
She seems to be a solarion

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:44:48):
The woman:
"I am Manee Moonpuncher.

And you lot must have been the group that helped the youths fix the hover bike.

I take it you lot are not here for some of my legendary dumplings, huh?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:45:55):
Manee Moonpuncher:
"Oh, also, since you're clearly mercenaries, I sell ammunition in my shop, along with consumable magic items, medpatches, hypopens, serums, and other consumables of 3rd rank, or lower if you don't need something as potent."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-05 00:47:26):
Mausbert smiles. "I wouldn't say no to some dumplings. Haven't gotten to eat much today."
Mausbert's stomach growls audibly at the thought of it, propably at the lingering smell of food as well.
"And yes. We are the one's that helped with the hoverbike."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-05 01:13:43):
Mausbert takes a bite out of the steaming dumpling, taking a deep breath through his mouth to cool it down, before he continues to chew and swallow the piece. He stifles a cough before replying:
"Oh.. those are delicious! Thanks" Mausbert swoons.
"What has happened in your basement? What do you think got attracted?"

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-09-05 01:29:38):
Chua will look for a second pair of chopsticks and attempt to spear a few dumplings before Mausbert eats them all.  "So did you notice any wierd smells or sounds beyond the sense of something not right?"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-05 01:46:35):
"Yeah.. Absalom's checks aren't as thorough as they should be. And I should know, I deliver goods to and from Absalom to the local system. Luckily, this one can't be my delivery. The last one I had was from Castrovel. Can I see the papers for that container?"
Mausbert snacks a second dumpling.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-09-05 02:13:01):
"We can certainly assist with this thing in your basement."

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-09-05 02:13:34):
*[image]* (Lysae will attempt to piece together what this could be - I assumed a Occultism check would be most relevant)

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-09-06 11:29:20):
Lysae will take the key. “We’ll do our best to keep the disturbance to a minimum.”

She turns to the others. “I’ve heard of things like this - spirits came up from time to time when I was researching… other matters. We’re almost certainly looking at a malevolent spirit tied to whatever is in that crate. It’s disturbed by living beings, especially ones with magical gifts, and will lash out to drain the life force from those who get too close.”

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-09-06 15:09:31):
Chua Looks towards Lysae.  "So you are saying we should not use any magic down there?"  Turns back to Manee, "Then one last question, Your not keeping any unstable compounds down there that might cause this place to explode if they meet a violent reaction say from gernades or Mines?"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-06 15:13:28):
"Or a stray laser."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-09-07 12:35:54):
Roneles" I will take the key"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-09-07 16:04:51):
open the chest with it

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-09-07 16:18:04):
move me then

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-09-07 16:23:27):
"Alright Roneless let's unlock the door and head down to certain doom."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-07 17:08:38):
Stone steps follow filtered light to a tomblike hall of worked stone. 

Three mismatched doors line the wall. 

One door is blocked by a stone slab with no obvious hinges or lock, another is an automatic door with an electronic control pad, and the third is an iron portcullis with a lock matching the key from Manee.

You unlock the iron portcullis and proceed into the basement.

Containers of every imaginable shape and size crowd the storage basement. 

A stone sarcophagus leans against a wall next to wooden chests crafted in an archaic style. Metal storage crates are stacked beside leather briefcases, and cloth satchels hang from hooks on the walls. 

Examining and cataloguing the trove of worthless tchotchkes mixed up with priceless relics in this room would take weeks of effort...

...but you can devise a simple storage method and clean up the most obvious messes with 4 hours of labor.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-07 17:09:15):
Do you start cleaning the basement?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-07 17:55:49):
What next? :)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-07 18:06:12):
Mausbert looks around for the crate in question, while being watchful for things that might hide and jump out after him.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-07 18:06:35):
@Askarans 

Do you start tidying?

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-07 18:09:27):
Yeah

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-09-07 22:09:15):
Chua sighs and also gets to work moving things.  Conscious not to attempt to pull upon the warp to make this task easier.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-09-07 22:12:07):
"Umm guys, isn't the thing that's in this basement that Lysae described gonna assault my frail ★SUPER IDOL BODY★ ? I don't like life draining tendrils much..."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-07 22:16:19):
Both of you give me a DC16 reflex save.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-09-08 17:22:03):
Hearing the loud noise Livy will reposition Roneles @Nemesiux to face it before curling up behind him
"AHHHHHH !! It's the GHOST!!! SAVE ME RONELES!! "

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-09-08 17:30:27):
"Shuuu shuu bad ghost"

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-09-08 23:44:02):
*[image]* Livy is going to use her danger awareness to look for any more dangers.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-16 02:54:31):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-16 02:55:26):
3 things happen.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-16 02:55:40):
1. As the boxes fall, more boxes look to be about to fall.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-16 02:56:03):
2. Two Giant Dust Weevils burrow out of the ground, disturbed by the boxes falling!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-16 02:56:27):
3. The Sarcophagus glows with dark energy...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-16 02:56:30):
COMBAT.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-16 02:58:32):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-16 03:04:24):
@Nemesiux 

Roneles wins initiative.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-17 00:19:29):
Disabled a device [athletics or thievery]

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-09-17 00:19:48):
*[image]* So Roneles can stop the boxes then.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-09-17 00:56:40):
*[image]* Roneles will whack the boxes back in place.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-17 01:18:36):
Critical success.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-17 01:18:41):
Boxes stopped.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-09-17 01:21:22):
*[image]* He'll use his bodyguard INTIMIDATION technique on the guy on the left:

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-09-17 02:15:09):
*[image]* ★★★★★★★★★★ SUPER IDOL LIVY ★★★★★★★★★★ uses her anthem .

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-09-17 02:16:08):
*[image]* She then uses weakening shot on the guy on the left. Hitting, dealing 5 damage and making him enfeebled 1.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-09-17 03:29:40):
Chua reacts as both his warpfield expands and his exocortex shoots a mine out towards the creature on the right.  Though he pauses before activating the mine as well he probably does not want to cause to much damage.  He then instead attempts to telekinetically fling a bolt at the rat on the right missing it.  Finally he activates his powered shield.(raise a shield)

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-09-17 03:42:23):
Chua reaches out to the warp and grabs that bolt and it ricochets off the wall and back into the critter he was aiming at.  (used warp reality reaction)

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-09-17 03:43:48):
(Do not think it applied the damage)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-18 21:16:54):
Machiq puts both Hands on the Weapon and calls others out to Get'em! before he makes a shot at it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-23 05:54:58):
Rip.

**Wafflemuncher** (2025-09-25 03:12:51):
With all the combatants dead, AOC becomes overcome with curiosity and floats towards the sarcophagus in the middle of the room. He immediately begins examining it and attempts to cross reference it to anything he might have learned about before.

**Wafflemuncher** (2025-09-25 03:12:55):

**Wafflemuncher** (2025-09-25 03:13:07):
(Not sure which you want, so I rolled both)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-25 03:52:28):
@wafflemuncher 

Reroll the 15?
