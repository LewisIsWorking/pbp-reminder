**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-01 18:05:07):
Are you proceeding onwards?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-03 17:41:38):
A very tall ladder leads...somewhere.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-03 17:41:56):
Neither the tour guide nor the tourists know where the ladder leads.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-05-03 17:51:33):
"Let me take a look," Lysae says as she approaches the ladder and slowly, stealthily, begins to climb. "Keep the light away from the top of the ladder," she whispers as she climbs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-03 18:10:33):
Also you reach the top of the ladder.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-05-03 18:17:29):
*[image]* well, shoot

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-03 18:20:44):
Your boots squeak on the way up.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-05-03 18:22:45):
Not immediately seeing anyone, Lysae waits for a minute to see if the squeak attracted any attention.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-05-03 18:53:19):
Yes - is it not the empty corridor I can see on the map?

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-05-03 19:08:09):
Lysae will inspect the area for any signs of enemies, or traps on the chest-like object.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-05-03 19:14:20):
*[image]*

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-05-03 19:18:08):
Lysae will climb back down the ladder. "It's clear. Just a chest off in the corner. I can go first if you want, or we can keep to our usual tactical movement order."

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-05-03 19:20:16):
Lysae nods, and maintains her typical overwatch position skulking along (Avoid Notice) at the back.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-05-03 19:31:58):
I can try to investigate if you like.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-05-05 19:39:30):
So the whole party arrives in front of the chest I assume.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-05-06 04:51:12):
Once we arrive near the chest, Chua will move forward to examine the chest for traps and potentially disarm/unlock it/

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-05-06 04:53:45):
Obviouslly he believes the chest has no security systems on it.  But is it locked?

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-05-06 04:53:48):
*[image]*

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-05-06 13:28:37):
Then Chua opens it, as seeing as there is nothing wrong with it. (bad choice)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-05-06 17:31:05):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-13 01:43:47):
.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-13 03:00:05):
As you go to open the chest.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-13 03:00:09):
The chest beeps.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-13 03:00:27):
Is a frost magic laser turret.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-13 03:00:56):
The turret is engraved with runes and blue gems and starts to release icy blasts.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-13 03:02:44):
As this happens two voices call out in sync:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-13 03:02:59):
"YOU SHALL NOT HARM HIM.

HE IS BORN.

HE IS AWAKE.

YOU ARE DEADDDDD."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-13 03:04:16):
Kessel Solaria wins initiative.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-13 03:04:21):
With 23

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-13 03:04:28):
The 2nd was frost turret with 17.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-13 03:04:43):
PLAYER SIDE.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-13 03:04:45):
Who goes first?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-13 03:08:53):
> Not taken their turn.

>> - Super idol Livy. @MrNegetZ 

>> - Chua Datafang. Bruce | Chua Datafang SF 

>> - Kaeda Sall. @Jbram_2002 

>> - Kessel Solaria. 

>> - Lysae. @Revan1734 

>> - Mausbert Gouda. 

>> - Roneles. @Nemesiux 

> Taken their turn.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-05-13 03:09:00):
Lysae will take analyze the turret, take careful aim at it's weak spot, and fire.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-05-13 03:09:30):
*[image]* That's a 14 on the recall knowledge

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-13 03:10:56):
*[image]*

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-05-13 03:13:33):
@PathWars - Are we supposed to be dazzled, or is that left over from something?

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-05-13 03:14:09):
*[image]*

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-05-13 03:14:54):
*[image]* 34 points of damage! but 12 of it is precision.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-13 03:15:13):
Even then, you shoot the frost crystal and BOOM: it explodes.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-05-14 13:58:57):
Chua hearing the additional threats to the north and south east from them turns towards the northern passage and activates his warp field.  ( 1ction) Then casts telekenetic projectile (2 actions) on a piece of wall paneling and sends it hurtling,  Seeing as the trajectory was off he pulls on reality and changes the outcome with his reaction focus spell and it hits.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-14 14:04:31):
He's dead.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-14 14:04:41):
You splatter shot his skull to pieces.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-14 14:05:00):
The crunch and SPLAAAA sound echo around the halls.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-14 14:20:38):

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-05-15 00:38:31):
*[image]* Scoring a ★CRITICAL HIT★ on the man(/rat?). She also manages to slow him down (critical hit deck #13 piercing: target is slowed 1 until the end of it's next turn)
on top of hindering his dexterity (Clumsy 2 from weakening shot crit)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-05-15 00:38:31):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-15 20:01:23):
Combat over.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-15 20:01:28):
+1 Hero points for everyone.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-15 20:01:59):
*[image]* The turret was concealing a chest containing the following:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-15 20:02:04):
First come first served on Foundry :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-17 22:11:53):
What next?

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-05-18 21:36:41):
"Given that the hostiles came from both the north passage and from the southern direction.  I would assume that we want to make sure no more are in either direction.  We should head back North first As I think that is closer to where we have already cleared out some threats, before resuming down the southern corridor."

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-05-19 13:31:27):
“We need to keep our objective in mind - to find a clear path out of here to get ourselves and the civilians clear.” Lysae pauses. “Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing in which direction the exit back up lies. Therefore, Chua’s suggestion makes the most sense. We should search in an orderly fashion.”

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-20 12:15:26):
So do you go West or North?

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-05-20 18:04:30):
(Yes)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-25 00:28:09):
You go North.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-25 00:28:16):
Through the corridor.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-25 00:28:46):
You come into a room that is a platform followed by shadowy depths.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-25 00:28:55):
There are ladders descending downwards...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-25 00:29:04):
Looking down from the access corridor's reinforced transparisteel viewing port, you peer into the abyss of Absalom Station's forgotten depths. 

One hundred meters below, the chamber spreads out like a technological tomb, its walls slick with condensation that catches the intermittent flicker of emergency lumens. 

The acrid stench of decay and industrial mildew rises through the ventilation shafts, carrying with it something else—something that makes your neural implants tingle with unease.

Two corroded durasteel maintenance ladders descend along the chamber's walls, their rungs worn smooth by countless hands over the decades. 

Bioluminescent safety strips pulse weakly along their length, casting eerie blue-green shadows that dance across the scene below.

The chamber itself is a graveyard of corporate excess—towering stacks of military-grade storage crates bearing the logos of long-defunct mega-corps create a maze of cover. 

Among them, you can make out the crumpled form of what was once human, now little more than decomposing flesh in a tattered environment suit, slumped against a container marked with radiation warnings in three galactic languages.

But it's the walls that truly disturb. 

Occult geometries spiral across every surface—some carved deep into the reinforced plasteel, others painted in substances that gleam wetly in the dim light. 

The symbols seem to writhe and shift when observed directly, as if alive with malevolent purpose. 

Your ship's AI would classify them as pre-Gap xenoglyphs, but there's something fundamentally wrong about their configuration, something that speaks to realities that shouldn't exist.

Movement below catches your enhanced optics. 

Five figures in makeshift robes work with fevered intensity around the crates, their hands stained with what appears to be both pigment and something far more visceral. 

They mutter prayers in languages that predate stellar civilization, their voices creating a discordant harmony that seems to resonate through the station's superstructure itself.

The air shimmers near the floor with an almost organic quality—patches of phosphorescent growth that pulse with their own rhythm, synchronized to no natural heartbeat you recognize.

Your tactical systems register multiple heat signatures, energy weapon charges building, and something else—a psychic emanation that makes your cybernetic implants ache with sympathetic resonance.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-27 03:01:47):
What next? :)

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-05-29 00:50:00):
Chua shudders as he steps back from the ladders.  "I really do not like what I am seeing down there, and would advise we don't go that way.   However I am pretty sure our way out and the answers to what happened here are through there.  Please tell me I am wrong."
