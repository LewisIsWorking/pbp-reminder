Lysae fades into the shadows and watches the guards and Julz intently, looking for any sign of hostility. She leaves her rifle on her back for now, but is poised to reach for it at a moment's notice. "Disgusting place," she murmurs to herself as she watches the proceedings unfold.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-08 20:13:00):
Assuming you all are sitting at the booth...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-08 20:24:21):
The skinny tracksuit wearing vesk takes a fat line of coke as he does so his gold necklaces clink together.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-08 20:25:13):
He brings his head up, wipes his nose, sniffs real deep and says VERY energetically:
"YO SO"
*clears his throat*
"Who we got here?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-08 20:25:53):
He continues:
"Julzakama is the name.

Well please, call me Julz.

Yous are looking some work is what I hear, and I got some work to give out."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-14 00:03:07):
What happens next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-17 12:11:00):
Julzakama starts HOWLING with laughter:

"HELL YEAH, NOW THAT IS A SHOW!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-17 12:11:44):
The turtle folk is not amused and continues to puff his cigar, impatiently.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-17 12:12:01):
Julzakama picks up on his companion's impatience.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-17 12:12:19):
Julzakama:
"As I said, the name is Julz.

What's your names?"

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-02-17 12:58:24):
From the shadows, Lysae observes the turtle folk’s impatience and the way Julz is impressed with Livy. Figuring that they’re safe from him, but that the turtle folk might like some assurances about combat prowess, she drifts forward out of the shadows.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-02-17 13:00:00):
“I’m Lysae. Marksman, scout, and whatever else is needed to get the job done, as well as the best shot in this bar. As Kaeda said, what are the details? Whatever it is, I’m sure we can get it done.”

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-18 06:04:41):
The turtle-man grumbles:
"Move along. Now."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-18 06:04:55):
Julz seems to lock in.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-18 06:10:04):
Julzakama says:
"I’ve got a lucrative job for you.

Just picked up a freighter with a colorful past—marketed as a 'great investment opportunity,' which is code for serious fixer-upper.

The deal was almost too good to be true.

Word on the Ring is, my guy towed it in from Azlanti space. Could be a jackpot in salvage… or a whole mess of trouble. I’d check myself, but I’m up to my horns in other work. That’s where you come in.

I need you to sweep the ship, log whatever’s worth selling, and—most importantly—clear out anything that shouldn’t have survived quarantine.

If you're in, take a shuttle to the Armada. My passcode will get you past the impound lock. Handle it, and you’ll get a prime cut of the haul… plus a little extra for the effort.”

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-18 06:10:30):
Julzakama pauses, sniffs deeply:
"Questions?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-18 06:10:54):
The turtle-man seems satisfied and relaxes somewhat, puffing his cigar.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-18 06:11:37):
What happens next?
:)

**JB Ram | Kaeda Starfinder** (2025-02-19 15:02:06):
Kaeda nodded, leaning back lazily in the booth. "Always gotta consider the three Ps," she replied, holding up a hand and counting them off on her fingers. "People, Problems, and Profit. I'd like to know any people we'll need to deal with, and problems you see us potentially running across, and how much our cut of the profit is. With those details ironed out, we should be able to do anything."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-22 22:26:23):
Julzakama continues:
"As for your cut, it completely depends on what's on the ship.
If it is shit, then a lot less.

I get more generous when I make more money!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-22 22:27:12):
Julzakama:
"AS for the aeon army, they come from ancient Golarion, they took a portal and they are human supremacist SCUM."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-22 22:27:41):
Julzakama seems to get a bit aggravated then takes a quick breath and says:
"Well well, anything else?"

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-02-22 22:56:19):
*[image]* To get a read on what the turtle folk's part in all this is

**JB Ram | Kaeda Starfinder** (2025-02-23 02:20:43):
*[image]* Perception - Sense Motive to see if Julz is scamming us or trying to kill us. I get a +1 because he is an asset, so result is a 15.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-26 04:15:04):
What happens next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-27 13:42:15):
What happens next? :)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-02-27 20:35:21):
"I think we have everything we need. We'll be done before you have time to listen to all my songs." Livy ★winks★
 "Let's go Roneles we have a shuttle to take"
Livy grabs Roneles and starts heading out.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-02-27 20:40:54):
"I hope it is not haunted"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-28 07:04:39):
The turtle man clears his throat and Julz nearly jumps out of his seat, shouting:
"You forgot this!!!"

And hands you a USB.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-28 07:06:58):
Julzakama says, assuming one of you comes back to get the usb:

"The passcode is 1607."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-28 08:35:51):
Julz:
"Good luck gang, you'll be sweet."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-28 08:36:04):
And Julz goes back to talking to his hoes.

**JB Ram | Kaeda Starfinder** (2025-02-28 13:37:09):
Kaeda smiled at Julz as she accepted the flash drive, her hand lingering to caress his gently during the momentary touch. A little flirting never hurt. "1607," she repeated, solidifying the number in her memory. "We'll be back in a jiff," she added before following ★Superstar Idol Livy★ and her ★Trusted Bodyguard Roneles★ to go find the ★Somewhat Grumpy Sneaky-Lady Lysae★ so they could skedaddle. Besides, this party was beginning to wear on her. All show, too little action. 

She was sure to find some action soon, if half of what Julz promised was true.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-02-28 13:48:32):
As she follows Kaeda out of the bar, Lysae moves up. "We should read what's on the drive before we get too far."

**JB Ram | Kaeda Starfinder** (2025-02-28 13:53:42):
Kaeda jumped as Lysae spoke up out of nowhere. "I'm not going to get used to that, am I?" she pondered. Holding the drive out to Lysae once they were outside, she added, "Be my guest. I'm not plugging that into anything I own. It probably has more viruses than those uncultured hoebags our quarry was ogling."

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-02-28 13:55:55):
"Yes, a public terminal would probably be wise." Lysae looks around for one.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-02-28 14:20:48):
Roneles murmurs under his breath " A ship of the sin empire..... I thought.... that .... she was righr after all?!"
