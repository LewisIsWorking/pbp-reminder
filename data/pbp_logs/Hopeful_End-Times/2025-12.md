The moment passes and Manee Moonpuncher's eyes turn more serious.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-10 12:37:27):
Manee Moonpuncher:
"I'll explain."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-10 12:39:10):
Manee Moonpuncher:
"Over the last few days shipments of various goods are being brought into the lower docks.

The lower docks are a complicated place.

Hundreds of years of different discarded spaceships fill the dockways.

Clearing it out would take a small army.

Except Dock 3.

Dock 3 (unknown to many) is clear and usable."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-10 12:40:01):
Manee Moonpuncher continues:
"I am a Shobhad.

And another Shobhad that I know is...or was using dock 3 to move cargo from...."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-10 12:40:39):
Manee Moonpuncher hesitates:
"Not exactly legal movers.
Real anonymous stuff. 

All I have is a name: Spicy Sweet."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-10 12:41:29):
Manee Moonpuncher continues:
"He's gone missing, not heard from him in a couple of days.
There's a lot of good sitting in dock 3. 
The other shobhad (his name is Tego) might be down there."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-10 12:42:04):
Manee Moonpuncher:
"I am a solarion, I *normally* command great solar magics and martial prowess but this whole....scream....situation"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-10 12:42:48):
Manee Moonpuncher starts making more dumplings in the adjoined kitchen, seemingly out of habit.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-10 12:43:02):
Manee Moonpuncher:

"It would take a LOT to make more powers go completely offline like this...."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-10 12:43:36):
Manee Moonpuncher (not looking up from making the dumplings) asks:
"So....interested in the job?

Recover the good and you'll be given 400 credits."

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-12-10 22:02:05):
Chua:  "I am always interested in money.  However I am not sure what the rest of the crew think.  They seem to be lost in contemplating the depths of your dumplings."

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-12-23 00:58:09):
"Well!" looking at the other members of the group and sighing he grabs a dumpling and tosses it @MrNegetZ Liv.  "Well I have not known for you to go completely without saying something for 10 minutes.   You have any thing you want to ask  before I commit us to this task?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-29 04:01:33):
What next? :)

**Brant Johnson** (2025-12-29 17:38:48):
Bones Longwhiskers reporting for duty!

Pathmuncher code 410186

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-30 22:17:37):
A creaking noise begins to emanate from the ceiling, and then it evolves into a groan, before finally giving way to a loud crash! 

Once the dust and debris settle, a furry creature with bright, colorful fur rests on the ground along with various other items. Empty water bottles and food trays litter the floor. A thin blanket and a couple of pillows lie scattered about. Judging by the mess, it would appear that this creature had been up there for more than a couple of weeks. 

The creature stands up, shaking his head and dusting himself off before taking a look around him to notice that he is not alone. His colorful fur quickly fans shades of pink and purple before settling back into a more generic rainbow pattern. "Uh..." He says as he slowly moves towards a bag on the floor. "I can fix that." Outside of the radiant fur, it is quite clear this individual is a Pahtra.

**Brant Johnson** (2025-12-31 17:18:56):
A lithe all black Pahtra enters the room and sits at a table by himself. He looks around the room expectantly as if he is waiting for an invitation or acknowledgement.
