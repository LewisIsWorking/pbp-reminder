Recap.
- September 5th @1:22: Manee Moonpuncher offered you each 100 credits for clearing out her basement plus a chance to loot anything not strictly inventory.
- September 23rd @05:54: Lysae fell through a portal. Through the portal was an ancient walled city.

One of the crates that fell on the group is not marked as inventory.

You open the unmarked crate and it is almost over spilling with ammunition, a cache of 100 projectile rounds.
Below the projectile rounds are:
- Five commercial batteries. 
- Two tactical batteries.
- 5 silver-coated projectile rounds worth 40 credits each. 

Manee Moonpuncher yells down the stairs:
".... Are you all ok....?
If that's everything come back up after grabbing anything you find. 
I have 100 credits each for you and a plate pilled up high with my legendary dumplings! 
I hope you're still hungry Machiq!"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-11-03 22:07:48):
Yee

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-11-04 00:24:59):
Chua will poke his nose in a few corners to make sure nothing else is still down here and for anything else that may have fallen off of inventory.  "I guess that answers my own question.  Let's take what we found and head on up and see if Manee is satisfied and get some more dumplings."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 19:06:35):
Manee Moonpuncher:
"Before you all go, could I trouble you all for a moment?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 19:06:59):
Manee Moonpuncher sort of leans over as she towers over you all, Manee Moonpuncher is clearly making sure you are all enjoying the dumplings.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 19:07:28):
Manee Moonpuncher:
"You did good guys.
Sorry to hear about your friend with the portal.
I, uh, yeah a lot of strange things, my powers have also been...odd"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 19:08:22):
Manee Moonpuncher:
"I have a shipment coming in, down in the lower docks.
If you lot were willing to go and sign for it.
I would but....."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 19:14:39):
Manee Moonpunche manifests a solarion solar weapon, but it flickers and fades:
"Yeah... The lower docks can be a bit dodgy...."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 19:28:08):
Manee Moonpunche looks at the group, waiting to see what they think.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-11-14 21:18:29):
after slurping a dumpling he looks back to Manee."So assuming you can not pick the package up as its in a rivals territory?.  Who would we be liberating the package from.  What type of interference could we expect.  Finally what are you offering in recompense?"  His whiskers twitch for a moment before he spears another dumpling and starts to chew it while he waits.
