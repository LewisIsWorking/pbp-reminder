**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-01 13:52:48):
"You are here with us know, so you might as well join us.  I am surprised that Liv and Roneless have not spoken up yet.  It is very un-Liv like for them to be so silent."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-03 02:50:41):
You go down the ladder.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-03 02:50:48):
The cultists, at first, don't react.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-03 02:51:09):
But after a few moments their eyes glow an unsettling dark light:
"AWAKE. AWAKE. AWAKE."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-03 02:51:10):
COMBAT.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-03 02:55:23):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-03 02:58:39):
Kaeda Sall turns to ash as the combat begins, the last words that leave her mouth:
"They. are. born."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-03 02:59:51):
A moment later, Kessel Solaria also says:
"A w a k e!"

The word turns from a whisper to a scream as the word leaves her mouth.

Kessel Solaria turns to ash.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-03 05:55:07):
*[image]* Chua shudders and watches as the 2 former members ash and in what may be fear or revulsion.  Activates his warp field and sends a richochet (dc 17 reflex save) at the 2 closest cultists. (targeted in red)

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-03 05:55:40):
"I think we should eliminate them I am not sure how many is needed to complete the full ritual."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-03 06:41:07):
@Ravnos1 

What form does your Tangible Object take?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-03 12:14:29):
Glowing with magical radiation.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-03 14:33:02):
Its my warp.field.  the main advantage it allows me to use anchor spells and for me.to do recall knowledge for free when I sustain.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-06 01:22:46):

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-06 23:30:13):
*[image]* Roneless jumps into action, sucking the enemies in like a black hole.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-06 23:30:50):
*[image]* He then locks eyes with one of them. Striking them with fear.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-06 23:35:10):
The black hole causes the mould altar to EXPLODE!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-06 23:35:33):
Roneles succeeds.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-06 23:35:36):
Nothing happens.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-06 23:35:41):
You breathe out the mould.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-06 23:36:06):

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-08 02:40:12):
"This guy still looks the healthiest! Get' Em!" Mausbert shouts, pointing to the man in the back, before unleashing phase bolts at him, which strike into the man with high precision straight through the head.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-09 00:04:17):
@Revan1734  KILL!!!

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-09 00:11:10):
Lysae draws her rifle off her back and sights in on the prone cultist in one fluid motion. Her finger tightens on the trigger a moment later, sending the shot straight through center mass.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-09 00:11:12):
*[image]*

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-09 00:12:19):
She swiftly ejects the spent shell and smoothly loads a new round into the rifle.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-09 00:43:11):
As the cult "leader" dies a smile of gratitude flickers upon her lips.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-09 00:44:29):
(Wafflemuncher isn't introduced yet so enemy turn or is it over?)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-10 15:50:11):
The fungus shows the group a vision of planets collapsing.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-10 15:50:20):
And that's it's turn.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-10 15:51:53):
"What the fuck?" Mausbert blinks

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-10 22:06:18):
Mausbert loads his Boom Pistol while taking a closer look at this fungus, to Acquire it as an Asset.
He fires and hits for 6 Sonic Damage. 
At last he attempts to recall knowledge on this thing.

(idk what to roll for RK)

**Wafflemuncher** (2025-07-11 02:09:29):
Arcanamirium Occult Campus floats stupefied for a moment. Analyzing the vision he was just gifted by the strange creature. This is pure knowledge and he must know more. Before he does anything else he begins to study the thing intently. (Analyze Target, Cantrip 1)

★ Super idol livy ★

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 06:00:30):
Your combined attack destroy the altar.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 06:00:45):
The altar TRIES to tap into your minds, to melt your mind, to turn you both to ash.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 06:00:48):
But.....

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 06:00:52):
Some stops it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 06:00:59):
And the altar instead, turns to ash.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 06:02:41):
*[image]* Loot added to stash.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 06:02:50):
Does anyone want monster parts?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 06:04:53):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 06:04:59):
Done it anyways :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 06:32:53):
Is the party going to:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 06:32:56):
- Area 6.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 06:32:59):
- Area 7.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 06:33:03):
- Area 9.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 06:33:11):
Of the ghost level.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-11 09:14:09):
We're going back up the ladder and going the other way(southwest) probably? Except if somebody wants something else

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-11 12:44:00):
If no one has taken the monster parts I can take them to keep them altogether.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 14:53:10):
So you can always make something cool later.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-11 15:14:49):
where would we see the stash?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 15:18:38):
Where your character sheet is

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 15:18:41):
Then right above

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 15:18:51):
Lots of cool stuff on the party sheet

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-15 06:08:02):
Is the party going to:

- Area 6.

- Area 7.

- Area 9.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-15 13:33:39):
Let's head to area 6 then.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-15 13:56:39):
I want to checkout a room we didn't.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-15 13:58:01):
*[image]* This one

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-15 15:39:48):
Fine.  It probably will lead to horrific death or maiming. After you.  :)

**Wafflemuncher** (2025-07-15 23:00:37):
After Super Star Livy

**Wafflemuncher** (2025-07-16 00:12:19):
After ☆SUPER IDOL LIVY☆

**Wafflemuncher** (2025-07-16 00:12:37):
(I don't know where the filled in star is)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-16 04:09:51):
★SUPER IDOL 的笑容★

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-16 09:41:18):
You find yourself in a hall of statues.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-16 09:43:00):
Carved into the marble, below a stone statue of a vesk:
"The enemy of my enemy has become my friend.
- KORUMUN."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-16 09:43:29):
@MrNegetZ 

You read this, and Livy, you seem to recognise that name, but... You aren't quite sure how.

**Wafflemuncher** (2025-07-16 13:06:19):
May Arcanamirium Occult Campus perform a recall knowledge check Occult or Religion maybe?

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-16 23:52:29):
*[image]* That's a 9 on my Recall Knowledge

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 00:09:43):
I'm not trained in society...

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 00:25:10):
Welp... To Area 6 we go! @PathWars

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 00:33:19):
Wafflemuncher you might want to choose what you do while we are moving (exploration activity)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 00:33:50):
*[image]* This is what our activities are for now.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 02:24:47):
Does anyone ELSE want to roll about this?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 02:25:53):
RONELES IS THE CHRONICLER!

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 02:25:56):
SO HE KNOW!

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 02:26:12):
HE ROLLS CHRONICLE LORE!

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 02:27:02):
OH WAIT

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 02:27:05):
HE HAS IT!!

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 02:27:51):
*[image]* ...

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 02:28:08):
Anyone wants to hero point their rolls?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 02:28:39):
He rolls LORE GOLARION!

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 02:29:25):
You gotta make up how he knows.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-07-17 11:51:27):
He is a divine soul!

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-07-17 11:51:51):
When a doomsday is aproaching the divine soul is spawn in order to stop it!

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-07-17 11:52:52):
And Urgathoa is a petty B amd won't let Se... I mean Roneles die

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 12:52:02):
Wafflemuncher 

You remember a phrase from a data log your eyes glanced over at a museum that put together information on the gap, and the time long before:

"The immortal/forever hero"
"Endless cycles"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 12:53:23):
......the statue comes to life, and swings its stone blade at the party.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-17 14:13:20):
"Fuck, that Statue is moving. Get it!" Mausbert shouts, using the Get 'Em! Action. 
Then with the mental excitement being high, he creates Phase Bolts in such a way that they appear out of phase with this dimension, making them invisible until they impact at their target.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 14:16:33):
@Askarans

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 14:16:52):
The answer is no, right ?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 14:17:05):
he attacks it with phase bolt

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 14:17:47):
@Askarans That hits.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 14:17:48):
Roll damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 14:18:43):
@Askarans 

It takes 1 point of damage after resistances are automatically applied.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 14:18:57):
A small chip of stone is removed.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 14:22:23):
It went from like 7 damage to 1.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 14:27:09):
*[image]* " ★WOW★ that statue ★MOVES★ Roneless ! ★SO COOL★... But i guess since it's trying to kill us i should stop it hmm.... ★ OK ★ let's get this ★MUSIC ON★"
Livy tries to activate her anthem... But fails...
" ★OH NO★ I FORGOT TO CHARGE IT!!! ★ WHAT★ are we going to do ★RONELES★ ?!! Wait.. ★AHA★"
Livy pulls out her microphone:
"This will work.   ★YAAAAAAY★!!! "
As she shouts into the microphone, the sound becomes very loud as it activates the spell chip and casts Sonic Scream.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 14:29:17):
She then aims at the statue, trying to find an opening she can exploit(any move/manipulate/ranged attack action will activate my hair trigger reaction).

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 14:43:29):
Still 0 damage from Sonic Scream.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 14:43:30):
He failed.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 14:44:21):
L

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 14:48:26):
Roneles following up will attack the statue with a wide Swing or a whirling swipe, coming around from his swing he delivers a downwards strike with his hammer to his primary target. He pins down the golem with his relentless attacks.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 14:48:56):
*[image]* Basic reflex against 5 damage.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 14:49:19):
*[image]* 14 damage from the primary target hit

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 14:49:57):
*[image]* Reflex save against getting Supressed

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 15:04:13):
*[image]* Also the golem treats every square adjacent to them as difficult terrain (so since suppressed reduces speed by 10, if they get supressed maybe it can't even move more than a square?).

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-17 15:44:05):
*[image]*

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-17 15:45:03):
Chua will analyze the statue to see if it can be dismantled.  Craft recall knowledge.  And if it can move in to start doing so.  Thievery check.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 15:45:51):
So two things:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 15:45:55):
1. Not a hazard.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 15:46:13):
2. It has a very strong weakness to electricity.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 15:46:25):
So you've only used 1 action.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-17 15:46:37):
Can i have a hero point back.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-17 16:03:16):
Chua will shout out it is not grounded well light it up with electricity.  He steps back five feet and then throws a lesser lightning vial at its feet.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 16:04:18):
So if the statue is entirely stone it can't conduct electricity...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 16:05:00):
You're right

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 16:05:15):
That means that that statue. IS ACTUALLY A ROBOT!!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 16:05:16):
The statue doesn't have any weaknesses.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 16:05:26):
However...

Immunities = bleed, death effects, disease, doomed, drained, fatigued, healing, mental, non lethal attacks, paralyzed, poison, sickened, spirit, unconscious, vitality, void.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 16:05:51):
@Ravnos1 

Hopefully that makes up for the blunder on my part.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 16:07:11):
It's a robot statue

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 16:07:14):
I retconned it

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-17 16:07:37):
it has Weakness 10+ to electricity.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-17 23:44:43):
Lysae will aim (Aim, Action 1) down her scope at the statue and see if she can determine the weaknesses (ie worst saves) of the construct (Recall Knowledge, Action 2).

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-17 23:45:17):
*[image]* (If that's a success, he'll be off-guard against my attack)

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-21 03:43:31):
Finishing Chua's turn I apologize not sure how to get my 2nd vial to be lightning so it threw as acid...but both would be lightning vials.  also 2nd attack the statue would also be off balance to me, so not sure if that would matter for a critical.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-21 03:43:49):
*[image]* 2 quick bomber attacks with lightning vials

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-21 03:44:44):

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-21 03:46:09):
so with the +10 weakness  14 and 13 points of damage from the 2 bombs and roneless unfortunately takes 2 splash damage as well.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-21 03:55:23):
Chua Shouts to **"This statue is not shielded versus overcharging via electrical attacks"  Then pulls 2 of his vials of lightning and throws them at the back of the statue. (eot)

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-21 04:13:16):
i remember that being a separate feet/ Im a chirugen subtype as well

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-21 04:19:56):
Though I am a chirugen, so i dont have the ignore splash damage.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-21 04:22:32):
and at the start of the day, i make so many lightning and other vials (8) and have 6 (versatile vials)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-22 03:29:18):
To shoot on the third action

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-22 03:35:39):
(bruh.)

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-22 03:37:40):
Has to do damage and i didnt

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-22 03:38:28):
It has to hit

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-22 03:38:52):
It clearly says 'on a hit'.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-22 03:39:09):
Not 'if it dealt damage'

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-22 12:40:20):
*[image]* Lysae will shout out that the statue is tough but can't dodge as she takes her shot. She hits for some damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 12:43:10):
It has seen better days (50%-ish health)

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-22 12:44:24):
I was saving Action 3 (Shoot) until it was off-guard, not realizing it was already off-guard

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 12:45:23):
@wafflemuncher 

It fails.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 12:45:54):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 12:50:19):
*[image]* @wafflemuncher Succeeds on the stumble saving throw.

**Wafflemuncher** (2025-07-22 12:53:15):
Arcanamirium Occult Campus will project to the group "This is a remarkably durable construct. I'm afraid the tools at my disposal are quite meager in comparison."

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-22 12:55:37):
*[image]* Lysae reloads, aims, and takes a second shot, but misses because the statue is too close. She calls out, "Move it back if you can. I need more distance."

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-22 13:07:20):
Yeah, if you could reroll that attack with one, I’d appreciate it

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 13:07:44):

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-22 13:45:49):
Chua will throw a field vial at Roneless then use telekinetic shrapnel against the statue, as he pulls up a side panel and hurls at it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 13:54:37):
T -> "Set target"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-22 14:54:59):
Mausbert screams as a headache overwhelms him as he Unleash Psyche. As he does so, the air seems to distort around him, forming lenses showing other spaces which disappear as quick as they appeared.
"Come on guys! We can do it!" 
He points and grunts in discomfort as he encourages all to Get' Em!, before unleashing another Amped Phase Bolt towards the statue.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-22 14:55:16):
*[image]*

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-22 17:19:13):
*[image]* ( It has to succeed the  fortitude save or be pushed towards the wall(it also wouldn't be able to grab him since not on range so it would probably need to move to him.) ).

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-22 17:25:25):
*[image]* ( Idk if it can go down towards that space. It's a bit tight but i think i managed to get tokens on it so it should be good without passing through the wall. )

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-22 18:05:32):
Livy's turn:
"Oh no Roneless you look like you're in a ★BAD SHAPE★. 
But don't worry as my ★SUPER IDOL POWERS★ will get rid of that very quickly."
Action 1 : She uses transfer vitality to heal the 8hp of Roneless. (already applied)
Action 2-3: Then casts ★ELECTRIC ARC★.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-22 18:15:05):
Roneles now healed and ready will do another 
2 action : WHIRLING SWIPE with his primary target being the statue.
Then he will raise his SOLAR SHIELD.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 19:20:52):
*[image]* Phase bolt destroys Korumun the statue.

No other loot.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 19:23:24):
Where to next?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 19:24:15):
AS THE STATUE IS DESTROYED, THE DOORS TO AREA 9 UNLOCK, THE SEAL BROKEN!

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-22 21:05:39):
Briefly after Mausbert's outburst, he slumps against the wall, holding his head in a headache. These weird bubbles begin to fade away while the ratfolk appears dizzy. It takes a few seconds for Mausbert to recover.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-22 21:27:05):
The group takes 10 minutes for Livy to Refocus and Roneles to take a breather (others can do stuff too)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-22 21:38:41):
Mausbert too takes the time to recouperate and refocus

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-22 22:21:31):
After everyone finished we can go to area 6 while going back to our normal activities.

**Wafflemuncher** (2025-07-23 01:53:23):
Arcanamirium Occult Campus will float along (preferably in the middle) with the group when they move out

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 07:18:22):
The door to Area 9 is unlocked.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 07:18:25):

WE NEED THE LOOT!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 07:23:30):
It's the last area besides the control room, which is the final area.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-23 07:23:30):
Wait did we explore all the other rooms?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 07:26:09):
The sign says:

"Maintenance Bay"

This maintenance bay is crowded with machinery. 

Piles of rusty junk mingled with items that look brand new litter
much of the floor.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-23 07:26:57):
Mausbert walks in to check on the computer.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 07:28:27):

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-23 07:33:09):
*[image]* "Ah fucking hell!" Mausbert startles as the heavy plop of slime falls onto the floor behind him, luckily not on him. 

"Get' Em!" Mausbert shouts,  before blasting his Boom Gun towards the slime.

Then making a beeline back towards the group.

(Everyone's attack now deals 1 additional damage)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-23 07:38:08):
" ★WOW★ what's that thing Roneles?!"
Livy looks at the new thing very curiuously.
"Actually it's kinda ★GROSS★ can you kill it?"
Livy then starts blasting her anthem on speaker
And casts electric arc.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-23 07:42:48):
Ronelles would probably say something like "Uhhg... Sure... I'll kill the thing..." with a deep sigh. 
Walk up to the slime and use his Whirling Swipe.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 07:44:38):
It critically fails the save.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 07:44:39):
@MrNegetZ

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-23 07:44:42):
*[image]* Primary target attack is a critical hit

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 07:45:52):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 07:45:56):
@MrNegetZ So this ?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-23 07:46:09):
It is imune to crits then.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 07:46:10):
I don't think it is immune to critically failing saving throws.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 07:46:18):
So I think it can take the 18.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-23 07:46:38):
Critically failling the saving throw means you take the effect of a critical hit from the attack

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-23 07:46:46):
So it's still immune probably

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 07:47:01):
Oh ok

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 07:47:10):
*[image]*

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-23 07:47:12):
Idk how it works exacly but i would assume so

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-23 07:47:29):
It's also suppressed

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-23 07:47:46):
And treats all adjacent squares as difficult terrain

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 07:48:45):
Double damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 07:48:47):

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-23 12:05:16):
*[image]* Lysae takes aim over the shoulders of her companions and takes the shot.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-23 12:06:15):
It's a awful lot of damage, unless it's immune to crits and precision damage, in which case it's 12 piercing damage

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-23 12:06:30):
She the reloads the rifle.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-23 12:13:44):
( 49 damage at level 1 is crazy)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-23 12:33:37):
(On a good crit I only can do like 26/28.. 32 max, not counting external damage bonusses)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 14:51:19):
Also it'll be taking a fraction of that.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-23 19:33:15):

Occultism or crafting and a computer check to open the final doors via the computer.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-27 16:48:18):
DC18 for both checks.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-27 16:49:57):
If anyone wants I can roll for yous, if you tell me what character is doing which check.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-07-27 16:51:08):
Chua would use computers and craft of needed to open the doors.   (Roll for me.please)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-27 16:51:23):
(Do the rolls have to be done by 1 person, or can they be split up?)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-27 16:52:18):
Mausbert would assist in both rolls.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-27 16:53:43):
But you HACK in.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-27 16:54:06):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-27 16:56:54):
You find a softly playing 3D planetary observatory.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-27 16:57:05):
There is a door to a master command room to the North.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-27 16:57:58):
And at some point several teams of robots would repair, clean and maintain the entire system.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-27 16:58:09):
These robots all seem to be all broken or deactivated.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-27 17:02:51):
At first, Mausbert would check on the roboters. especially those that are only deactivated. 
Mausbert would take a bit of time to study them to try and physically disable them in case they reactivate and become aggressive

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-27 17:06:13):

"Oh, come on!" Mausbert shouts annoyed. "The one time I wanted to disable the danger preemptively.."

"Get it!"Mausbert shouts, applying Get 'Em! to the robot he just tried to work on, before unleashing amped Phase Bolts towards the robot.

(Apply Get' Em to the Robot with Lead by Example pls)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-27 17:33:36):
Livy will move to a better position. Using mobile aim to aim at the flying bird. Preparing to shoot it if it tries anything (reaction hair trigger)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-27 17:34:05):
She will then cast electric arc targetting both the robot and bird

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-27 17:59:51):
Roneles cannot hit the bird 'Yet' Therefore he will walk up under it and use Black Hole (he would also target the robot if it was still alive)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-27 18:00:40):
The Robot explodes.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-27 18:02:15):
Oh 15 feet closer first

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-27 18:02:17):
So 2 damage

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-27 18:02:26):
5ft fall is no damage?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-27 18:02:30):
Or it can arrest a fall.
