## Week 9 (Feb 23–Mar 01)

### 📅 Sunday, Mar 01

**Anthony NegetZ** (2026-03-01 00:04:08):
Would be even more awesome if we now arrived at Smugler's dock

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:09:35):
...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:10:32):
Right, the party's heading to Dock 3.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:15:58):
You go to a lift.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:16:02):
You all get in.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:16:07):
It takes you down a few levels.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:16:13):
Then you get out.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:16:41):
You walk through 100s of metres of corridors across grated, steamy hallways.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:16:55):
You go down metal grate stairs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:16:58):
And more stairs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:17:02):
More corridors.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:17:05):
And eventually.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:17:11):
You make it to the Docks.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:17:16):
This place is a spaceship graveyard.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:17:38):
Thousands of ships lay here in many pieces.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:17:50):
All from different periods of spaceship history.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:17:56):
The whole place smells like engine grease and burnt ozone.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:18:07):
A boneyard of hulls, engine blocks, and half-gutted starships.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:18:20):
There are Six bays.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:18:28):
You already know you need to go to dock 3.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:19:03):
Dock 3 is one of the tidier bays.

Metal scaffolding rises up high into the air.

Gantries crisscrossing overhead like iron ribs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:19:16):
You keep going.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:20:06):
At the end of the dock is a body laying facedown on the ground, unmoving.

They are a shobhad dock worker.

Four arms spread out.

There is a Laser pistol dropped inches from his fingers.

He's not moving. 
Maybe dead, maybe not.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:20:16):
A scuffed cargo shuttle sits at scaffold level, entry hatch open.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:21:05):
You all spot two small figures crouching behind cargo containers near the shuttle, rotolasers trained on the walkway.

Goblins.

They look to be station-born based on their gear and appearance: 

Patchwork armour, oversized goggles and twitchy trigger fingers.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:21:28):
A third goblin leans out of the shuttle hatch.
Bigger.
Meaner.
Missile launcher resting on her shoulder.

Their leader.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:21:33):
She spots the party and bares her teeth.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:23:18):
The female goblin:

"That's close enough, tall-folk!
One more step and I turn your kneecaps into modern art!
I'm Spicy Sweet and I ain't having my day get any worse!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:29:03):
What next? :)

**Anthony NegetZ** (2026-03-01 02:30:11):
Did she lie?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:31:10):
?

**Anthony NegetZ** (2026-03-01 02:31:38):
Answer the question.?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:39:41):
What question? Also, this is the PBP topic. There is a CHAT topic.

**Anthony NegetZ** (2026-03-01 03:15:11):
Livy pouts:
"There is no way that could happen, as you are now in the presence of the one and only ★SUPER IDOL LIVY★ therefore your day can only get ★BETTER★!"
She then does the signature ★IDOL POSE★.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 03:25:15):
Uh roll diplomacy lmao

**CzarChasm23 "Lowda Medina"** (2026-03-01 04:09:53):
Lowda hangs back slightly as the group takes in the scene—old habit from Diaspora salvage runs, where the first one forward was usually the first one hauled back to the med bay. His eyes sweep the dock, cataloguing: goblin positions, sightlines, the Shobhad's stillness.

Then Livy strikes her pose. Pulse #423 does a slow, deliberate orbit around Lowda's head, as close to a sigh as a floating cloud of gemstones can manage.

"Spicy Sweet," Lowda calls out, pitching his voice calm and level—the tone you use for startled animals and jumpy sentries. He keeps his large hands visible and slightly away from his sides, palms out. "We're looking for a Shobhad named Tego. Manee Moonpuncher sent us—she's worried about him. And about you." Glancing down at the body, he raises his voice slightly, "Tego? How are you doing , friend?" Moving his gaze back to Spicy Sweet, he continues talking - mostly to Tego but also to the goblins, "can we get you some medical attention?"

(I'd like to also cast Animist cantrip Guidance on myself as Lowda briefly wonders if these ghosts can be of any help here, just for a little boost in the next few moments if it's needed)

**Anthony NegetZ** (2026-03-01 14:40:17):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 23:38:04):
Your performance check (which is a diplomacy check thanks to impressive performance, https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=5159) was a 9 which you hero point rerolled into a 19.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 23:42:24):
Spicy Sweet's finger tightens on the trigger.
Then Livy hits the pose.

Full ★IDOL POSE★.

In a dock that smells like burnt fuel and blood.

Surrounded by goblins about to kill her.

Next to a possibly dead 4 armed man.

One of the goblin gunners lowers his rotolaser half an inch.
"...Boss, is she famous?"

Another says:
"I think I am on her OnlyIdol?"

"Shut up, Grikk. Fuck up Mort."

But despite her words, Spicy Sweet's aim has drifted.
She's lowered her weapon just a fraction.

The missile launcher's still on her shoulder but she's looking at Livy like she's trying to solve a strange problem.

Then Lowda speaks.

Calm.
Hands out.

You names the dock worker.
You names Manee.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 23:45:08):
That lands different.

Spicy Sweet's eyes narrow, not exactly in distrust but almost surprise:
"Moonpuncher sent you?"

Spicy chews on that for a second before saying:
"That big idiot on the floor pulled a gun on us the second we stepped off the shuttle.
We're delivery crew.
DELIVERY.
He saw goblins and fired first, ask questions later."

Spicy continues:
"We got crates full of Moonpuncher's stuff and half the neighbourhood's orders sitting in our hold and this four-armed moron decided today was the day he'd play station security."

Spicy spits over the railing, her slobbers landing on the body of Tego:
"He ain't dead.
Stunned him.
Could've done worse."

The missile launcher comes down off her shoulder.
She hasn't stowed it / put away.
She's just lowered it a bit and stopped her lock on sequence.

Spicy Sweet:
"You want him?
Take him.
You want the cargo?
Someone signs for it.
And tell Moonpuncher she owes me hazard pay."

On the ground, Tego groans.

One of his four hands twitches.

Tego is alive.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 23:46:34):
Congratulations, you have MOST LIKELY avoided combat.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 23:47:11):
Spicy Sweet:

"Oh and we set up landmines so we'll disarm them now."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 23:47:33):
*@MrNegetZ*

As Livy looks down, she will notice that she is centimetres from standing on a land mine.
