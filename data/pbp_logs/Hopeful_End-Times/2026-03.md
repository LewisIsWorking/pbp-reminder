**Anthony NegetZ** (2026-03-01 00:04:08):
Would be even more awesome if we now arrived at Smugler's dock

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:09:35):
...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:10:32):
Right, the party's heading to Dock 3.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:15:58):
You go to a lift.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:16:02):
You all get in.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:16:07):
It takes you down a few levels.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:16:13):
Then you get out.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:16:41):
You walk through 100s of metres of corridors across grated, steamy hallways.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:16:55):
You go down metal grate stairs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:16:58):
And more stairs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:17:02):
More corridors.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:17:05):
And eventually.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:17:11):
You make it to the Docks.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:17:16):
This place is a spaceship graveyard.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:17:38):
Thousands of ships lay here in many pieces.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:17:50):
All from different periods of spaceship history.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:17:56):
The whole place smells like engine grease and burnt ozone.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:18:07):
A boneyard of hulls, engine blocks, and half-gutted starships.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:18:20):
There are Six bays.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:18:28):
You already know you need to go to dock 3.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:19:03):
Dock 3 is one of the tidier bays.

Metal scaffolding rises up high into the air.

Gantries crisscrossing overhead like iron ribs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:19:16):
You keep going.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:20:06):
At the end of the dock is a body laying facedown on the ground, unmoving.

They are a shobhad dock worker.

Four arms spread out.

There is a Laser pistol dropped inches from his fingers.

He's not moving. 
Maybe dead, maybe not.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:20:16):
A scuffed cargo shuttle sits at scaffold level, entry hatch open.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:21:05):
You all spot two small figures crouching behind cargo containers near the shuttle, rotolasers trained on the walkway.

Goblins.

They look to be station-born based on their gear and appearance: 

Patchwork armour, oversized goggles and twitchy trigger fingers.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:21:28):
A third goblin leans out of the shuttle hatch.
Bigger.
Meaner.
Missile launcher resting on her shoulder.

Their leader.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:21:33):
She spots the party and bares her teeth.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:23:18):
The female goblin:

"That's close enough, tall-folk!
One more step and I turn your kneecaps into modern art!
I'm Spicy Sweet and I ain't having my day get any worse!"
