**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 16:35:48):
Robot is dead btw.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 16:42:06):
Waiting on yous two.

**Wafflemuncher** (2025-08-02 21:36:27):
Arcanamirium Occult Campus will target the single remaining enemy

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-02 21:37:35):
@Revan1734

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-03 01:39:44):
*[image]* (Lysae's turn: mobile aim, recall knowledge, shoot)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-03 17:51:25):
It's dead.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-03 17:51:26):
Combat over.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-03 17:51:32):
What do yous do now?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-03 19:21:50):
It seems like it could active the planetarium.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-03 19:22:08):
Activating the planetarium would also likely restart the lift systems.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-03 20:04:44):
Mausbert heads to the computer and attempts to activate it.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-08-03 20:36:13):
“Wait! Some of the other computers down here have been trapped. We should look it over first.”

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-04 10:24:13):
DC 15 computers check to activate the computer.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-04 12:29:03):
And @Revan1734 has a trap finder so they get that too (for traps only though)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-04 13:38:05):
Mausbert waits to check the computer until the room is cleared.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-04 14:46:44):
For the trap finder feat, don't wait for me, just roll.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-04 15:15:01):
Because you're the DM you do passive rolls

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-04 15:15:22):
You need to keep in mind the passive stuff that the people have

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-04 15:15:36):
And roll when it comes up.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-04 15:16:20):
But for this time I'll roll

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-04 15:20:28):
*[image]*

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-08-04 15:22:01):
*[image]*

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-04 18:13:13):
"Well it seems like there's ★NOTHING HERE★ except the control panel that will get us back up to the main part of the station. ★LET'S GO★ everyone, we still have a ship to ★INSPECT★."

**Wafflemuncher** (2025-08-04 18:14:19):
Arcanamirium Occult Campus will bob along in agreement, and stay by ready to assist (aid) Mausbert should he need it.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-04 18:27:11):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-04 18:29:52):
Because

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-04 18:30:04):
You all get ELECTRICALLY SHOCKED!!!!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-04 18:30:38):
DC 14 crafting check to disable the electricity trap.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-04 18:30:45):
However it will shock you again if you fail.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-04 18:30:55):
Also you all take 12 damage.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-04 18:38:48):
*[image]* This room here?

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-04 18:53:30):

*[image]*

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-04 19:44:24):
*[image]* Workbench hero point thing still not working.
You sure it's not somewhere else now?

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-08-05 05:46:56):
*[image]* save versus incompetence.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-08-05 05:49:37):
@Askarans "Mausbert could you take a little bit more time before you try to deactivate the computers.  If you have not figured it out this place is a death trap.  One wrong hexadecimal code string and we are all dead. "

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-05 05:54:01):
Mausbert sighs, his fur stands on end from the shock.
"I guess you're right. But the one time, I did try to make sure the robots don't come alive, they still did. So whether I'm cautions or not, we're still getting fucked over.." 
He grunts in frustration.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-08-05 06:04:10):
"We need to work as a team, and start to determine who is the best at what tasks.  So we can partner up if needed.  Also if I fail I can just rewind time briefly."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-06 23:26:02):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-06 23:26:27):
Check to disable the electrical trap?

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-06 23:27:23):
(Yes)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-06 23:27:49):
Almost a critical success.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-06 23:28:43):
23 is a critical success.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-06 23:28:46):
No damage for Livy...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-06 23:30:28):
Check to reactivate the computer system.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-06 23:30:57):
DC 15 computers check.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-06 23:54:27):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 00:02:44):
1. The planet viewing system reactivates.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 00:03:07):
You see the Sun and the planets rotating around it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 00:03:53):
The planet of nocturn: the planet of dark gods and horrific monsters.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 00:04:08):
Nocturn is shaking, fading in and out of reality.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 00:04:28):
2. The lift is active. The party get in, and leave the ghost levels.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 00:04:32):
Congratulations.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 00:04:38):
You are level 2!!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 00:04:46):
Story 1 complete.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-07 00:12:32):
"★YAY★ finally out of this place Roneless. It wasn't a very great place, there was a severe lack of ★FANS★ in there. Problem... Even with the guides giving us a bit of money we are still ★BROKE★. We'll need more monney for my ★TOUR★ Roneless @Nemesiux ."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-08-07 00:15:10):
"I am broke. Remember?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-08-07 00:17:04):
"Great....."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-07 00:19:25):
"I don't have much money either.. shuttling people around the system doesn't get paid enough.."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 00:19:50):
This conversation is happening as the lift ascends through the station.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-08-07 00:42:44):
"alright, so you got through all of that, and now we return, we were going to check out a new ship, is what we encountered what we were supposed to do?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 00:44:30):
Over your comms you hear a familiar voice:
"Hey hey, is this thing on?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 00:44:36):
It is the voice of your boss.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 00:44:42):
Julzakama:
"You guys there?"

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-08-07 00:46:59):
Pulling out his comm unit.  "Yes, we are still here.  Were you hoping we were not?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 00:48:20):
Julzakama:
"You little shits are VERY lucky.
You know how I was gonna send you to check out a ship?
Well, SOMETHING BIG has happened. 
And well, if yous hadn't gotten stuck, you'd all be dead dead dead dead right now."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 00:49:09):
Julzakama:
"On the lift's transport panel select 'little Akiton' cause that's where you bunch are going to next."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 01:01:36):
Julzakama:
"Go find my friend Nikk-Nakk at the east end scrapyard.
They will explain further.

If you need supplies? 
Go see Sunny-6. 
He’s serving free meals at his diner. 
Word of advice: don’t get the gravy grubs. Nasty bug food.

The community center has a first aid clinic and plenty of spare cots, but Joia will put you to work. 

Nikk-Nakk does repairs, trade-ins, and sells junk for a fair price. 

Manee’s bodega has supplies, too. 

Someone at one of the apartments might be willing to trade for anything else you need.

Any questions?"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-07 01:06:17):
Mausbert shivers in worry. 
"My boss is probably gonna kill me though.. I was supposed to bring a delivery to Castrovel." 

Mausbert switches to a different channel, to try and contact his company's boss.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-07 01:37:26):
Also while in the elevator, Livy played some songs since she had access to the infosphere and used transfer vitality to heal Arcanium and Lyssae 's health portion to full(7 for lyssae and 6 for arcanium for a total of 13/14 of her lvl 2 vitality network.)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-07 01:38:35):
*[image]* (i applied healing to Lysae but can't for arcanium @wafflemuncher )

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-07 01:43:16):
"That's weird.." Mausbert tries to contact a colleague instead, while the connection is attempted to be established, Mausbert says. "Normally my boss always answers the Comm.."

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-07 01:44:10):
"★OH NO★ maybe he fired you and doesn't want to talk to you anymore. But that would be pretty ★MEAN★."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-07 01:45:54):
"It's AbadarCorp. They wouldn't do that."

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-08-07 01:48:06):
"Or maybe we still are not in our original universe and are in a slightly different dimension."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 17:08:22):
The lift arrives.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-07 17:14:50):
Was there a charging station in the elevator?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-07 17:23:56):
Bro didn't even read player core

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-07 17:41:00):
https://2e.aonsrd.com/actions/41-recharge

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-07 17:44:24):
*[image]* But Battery needs to be completely empty.
But I have this to work around it;

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-07 18:12:08):
Probably just bad wording on their part

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-07 18:13:21):
Charging stations are found in most buildings and ships though.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-07 18:13:31):
And there is no mention of them costing anything.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-08-07 18:18:47):
*[image]*

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-08-07 18:22:26):
Basicslly you find your usb c cable and plug it in somewhere.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 18:48:11):
Then there are no costs.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-07 22:17:38):
AI said this.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-07 22:24:39):
Damn AI got that data quick lol

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 22:58:12):
Julzakama:
"The ceo of the last 2 decades is Executive archdirector Gevrant Iseki-Okaibo."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-07 23:01:22):
(Does this name ring a bell for me? Is this the CEO I remember?)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-07 23:02:53):
Mausbert clears his throat. "Mausbert Gouda. I work for AbadarCorp, but I'm worried since I have no contact to my boss or colleagues."

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-08-07 23:11:59):
"A major distortion to the laws of reality fudged the universal constants here."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-07 23:24:11):
"Oh- a few weeks ago when I was coming back from Castrovel, I had something weird happen to me. Since then I can warp space to an extent.."

**Luke Skillen** (2025-08-09 14:18:58):
I am from a place called wolf tooth and I am on holiday in NIKK-Nak (Rino) 👀

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 14:44:09):
Ok so

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 14:44:13):
The lift has arrived.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 14:45:28):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:08:05):
1.
The lift's hydraulics release with a sharp *hiss* as the battered steel doors grind apart, revealing a symphony of controlled chaos that assaults your senses immediately.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:30:36):
2.
The first thing that hits you is the *smell*.
A potent cocktail of recycled air, engine coolant, organic waste from the hydroponic farms, and the unmistakable metallic tang of welding plasma that seems permanently embedded in every surface).

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:30:54):
3.
Before you stretches a labyrinthine canyon carved from the bones of dead starships.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:31:12):
4.
Towering walls of shipping containers rise in precarious stacks that seem to defy both physics and common sense.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:31:26):
5.
Some containers gleam in pristine corporate silver while others rust in shades of orange, tagged with graffiti in a dozen alien scripts.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:31:30):
6.
Mag-clamps and hastily welded joints hold the makeshift towers together, while jury-rigged power cables snake between them like technological vines, sparking occasionally where the insulation has worn thin.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:31:43):
7.
The *sound* is overwhelming: 
the constant drone of life support systems, 
the rhythmic *clang-clang-clang* of someone working metal in the distance, muffled arguments bleeding through thin container walls in at least three languages, 
and underneath it all, 
the low thrumming of massive machinery that keeps this artificial world spinning through the void.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:32:03):
8.
Above, 
a holographic sky stretches in an almost mockingly cheerful blue, 
complete with drifting white clouds that cast realistic shadows on the grimy deck plating below.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:32:09):
9.
But the illusion is far from perfect.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:32:25):
10.
Bullet holes and scorch marks pepper the projection like stars, 
revealing glimpses of the station's true ceiling: 
a maze of ventilation shafts,
power conduits and atmospheric processors that pulse with their own alien light.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:32:37):
11.
A grotesquely cheerful holographic sun beams down with an intensity that makes the sweat immediately begin beading onto your skin.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:33:05):
12.
*DING-DING-DING!*
The tinny jingle echoes through the cramped streets as the holographic sun's face stretches into an unsettling grin.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:33:16):
13.
"☀️ *Sunny time, fun time! 
Come try Sunny-6's famous Arcturian grub casserole, now with 40% more protein!* ☀️"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:33:27):
14.
Almost immediately, 
the sharp *crack* of a projectile weapon answers the advertisement, 
followed by derisive laughter from somewhere above.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:33:46):
15.
A small piece of debris that looks like part of a food container clatters down near your feet.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:33:46):
16.
The "streets" are barely worthy of the name.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:33:56):
17.
They're more like narrow canyons between the container towers where every available inch has been claimed for something.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:34:21):
18.
Hydroponic gardens jury-rigged to fire escapes drip condensation that's been channeled into collection gutters.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:34:22):
19.
A Shirren merchant has set up shop in what was clearly once a waste management alcove, 
hawking data chips and neural stimulants to a small crowd of dock workers still grimy from their shifts.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:34:36):
20.
To your left, 
a group of human teenagers in patched environment suits are tinkering with what looks like a heavily modified hoverbike,
its anti-gravity generators crackling with unstable energy that makes your teeth ache.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:34:55):
21.
To your right, 
an elderly Vesk woman tends to a small garden of bioluminescent fungi growing directly out of the deck plating, 
the alien plants pulsing with an ethereal purple light that seems to respond to her touch.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:35:11):
22.
The air itself shimmers occasionally with barely contained magical energies.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:35:20):
23.
This is (probably) overflow from poorly shielded arcane devices and improvised spell-tech scattered throughout the district.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:36:13):
24.
You catch glimpses of runes carved into bulkheads, some glowing softly, others dark and dormant.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:36:23):
25.
The whole place feels like a powder keg of technology, 
magic, 
and desperate ingenuity that could either create miracles or explosions at any moment.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:36:29):
26.
And underneath it all,
there's something else.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:36:34):
27.
 A sense of *community* forged in defiance of the corporate indifference that built this place.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:36:42):
28.
People nod to each other as they pass, children dash between the adults' legs in games that seem to involve both mundane toys and what might be minor magical constructs, 
and the smell of actual *cooking* (not just recycled protein paste) drifts from several directions.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:36:49):
29.
This is Little Akiton: 
a place where the unwanted and the unwelcome have carved out something resembling a life in the forgotten corners of the galaxy's greatest space station.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 15:37:03):
30.
It's rough, 
it's dangerous, 
and it's absolutely alive in ways the sterile corporate sectors could never manage.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-08-11 16:37:56):
"Perhaps I should assist here.  Repairing vehicles was my first job on my families shipping fleet." Chua walks forward and his custum rig starts to extend necessary tools to work on the bike.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-11 17:49:20):
"I'm more familiar with spaceships, but we should be able to figure this out."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 18:00:26):
Ok, this is going to be two checks: 
Crafting to repair the physical aspects of the bike 🚲 

Computers check to reboot the bike's onboard computer 🖥️

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-11 20:12:04):
*[image]* As Chua works on the Vehicle, Mausbert makes the proper calculations for the physics involved so Chua can set the correct calibrations. (Aid Check for Chua's craft)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-11 20:12:39):
*[image]* (Computer check to properly boot the hoverbike)

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-08-11 21:30:27):
*[image]* Correct roll with hero point spent.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-11 22:05:46):
"★WOW★ Roneles ! (@Nemesiux)  The city's atmosphere looks unchanged. That means that my ★FANS★ are probably doing fine. Julz scarred me with his explanation for a bit. "

**Wafflemuncher** (2025-08-11 23:48:45):
Arcanamirium Occult Campus slowly floats behind the group; taking in the scene in full. He briefly considers following Chua and Mausbert but his curiosity over the Vesk woman's plants gets the better of him. He floats in her direction and once in range communicates with her. "Hello ma'am, I am known as Arcanamirium Occult Campus and your plants intrigued me. Would you be willing to answer a few questions about them?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-12 00:01:55):
The old vesk woman asks you:
"Have you had the visions too?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-12 01:23:41):
The fungi seem to glow as you look at them directly.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-12 09:42:25):
This surface causes the small bubble to "stick" to the larger bubble without being fully absorbed.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-12 09:43:14):
As this is happening, the party watches as the fungi all grow a few centimetres as if draining Arcanamirium Occult campus's life force, as if feeding upon your cranium friend.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-12 09:59:32):
You've accomplished in 15 minutes, what would have taken them weeks.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-12 10:06:53):
Fungi grows below the dwarven teenager and briefly glows brightly.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-12 10:07:29):
The dwarf shakes his head:
"Ah not another vision"

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-08-12 13:53:05):
"What do you mean another vision?"

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-08-12 17:01:50):
"We had one as well.  About something awakening.  We also know that some people are gaining additional talents as if they have lead 2 existances at the same time.  What are these extra visions?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-12 17:07:28):
The dwarf says:
"I'm not into all this occult shit, but if you want to learn more about it, that Nerd Arta and her freaky friends are more than enough to get you up to speed."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-12 17:08:33):
"Where can we find them?"

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-08-12 17:11:31):
"Hmm.  Sounds like you might have awakened as a warpwitch.  What you described is similar to what I see."  He then extends his warp field around them.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-12 17:12:58):
Dwarf:
"You can get it from there."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-12 17:13:25):
Give me a DC 16 computer check to trace Arta's location.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-12 17:19:16):
*[image]* Mausbert begins to spend 10 minutes scouring the Infosphere for information about Arta. 
If he has enough information about her, he sets her as his asset.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-12 17:19:29):
*[image]*

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-08-12 17:32:36):
Lysae looks at the address over Mausbert’s shoulder. “We need answers. Maybe this Arta  knows something. If nothing else, perhaps we can eliminate her as a source of information if it turns out she’s some kind of nut.”

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-12 18:43:26):
"We can give it a try." Mausbert says, looking back up towards Lysae. 
He turns back towards the Dwarf. "Thanks, dude."
Then he turns towards the teen on the hover bike. "Good luck to you."

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-08-12 20:02:13):
Retracting his tools back into his rig.  "I guess we can check out that location you located."

**Wafflemuncher** (2025-08-12 22:27:35):
AOC thanks the lady for her time and wishes her well before leaving and rejoining the group. With everyone collected he relays his conversation and the subsequent vision he had.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-14 11:45:00):
With everyone gathered up again, Mausbert leads the way towards the address he found out.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:38:56):
Ok

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:45:41):
You go to Arta's apartment building.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:47:42):
The party find themselves outside a towering monolith of bio-metallic architecture that stretches toward the perpetual twilight of the station's artificial sky.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:47:48):
Arta's residential complex is a testament to corporate excess and technological decadence.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:47:52):
Forty stories of gleaming chrome and living crystal that pulses with veins of arcane energy running through its superstructure like luminescent blood.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:47:59):
The building's facade writhes subtly, 
its smart-matter surface shifting between transparency and opacity as privacy fields flicker on and off in response to the residents' needs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:48:09):
Holographic advertisements in a dozen alien scripts spiral around the tower's base, 
peddling everything from combat stimulants to illegal memory modifications, 
their lurid colors painting the surrounding plaza in strobing neon.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:48:15):
The entrance lobby beyond the plasma barriers reeks of ozone and expensive synthetic pheromones.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:48:24):
Security drones drift lazily overhead like mechanical angels, their scanning arrays sweeping constantly for weapons, 
contraband, 
or unwelcome visitors.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:48:34):
The floor beneath your feet is warm 
(heated by geothermal conduits that tap directly into the station's power core), 
while overhead, 
a massive chandelier of crystallized starlight casts rainbow fractals across surfaces that shouldn't be able to reflect light that way.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:48:40):
Residents move through the space with the fluid grace of the genetically enhanced and cybernetically augmented.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:49:05):
A Kasatha businessman phases through a quantum turnstile, 
his four arms never breaking rhythm as he conducts three separate business calls through his neural implants.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:49:11):
Near the elevators, a Shirren collective-mind argues with itself in harmonic overtones while a modified Ysoki tinkers with what appears to be a portable singularity generator, 
its gravitational field warping the air around it like heat shimmer.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:49:14):
The elevator bank itself is a marvel of technological excess.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:49:21):
They are translucent tubes filled with antigrav fluid that can transport residents to any floor in seconds, 
or through dimensional folds to entirely different sections of the station.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:49:24):
Warning runes in Ancient Azlanti script glow softly around each elevator shaft, 
their magical warnings about dimensional instability doing little to deter the building's affluent tenants.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:49:31):
What happens next?

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-16 16:23:38):
(Have I figured out her Apartment Number?)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-16 16:29:52):
You can buzz her, if you want.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-16 16:33:49):
Mausbert walks over to the doorbell device thingy. His fingers deftly scroll through the list of apartment numbers and names. He taps onto Arta's bell.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-16 16:34:30):
A pause.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-16 16:34:33):
A long pause.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-16 16:34:49):
Then a woman's voice going:
"Uh....hello? Did you buzz the wrong number?"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-16 16:36:37):
"Not if you're Arta!" Mausbert says. "We have heard you're a nerd for things occult. Me and my friends here want to talk about what you think about the scream. Got some time?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-18 07:00:45):
There's a pause and the woman says:
"One minute."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-18 07:00:58):
And several minutes later...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-18 07:01:06):
This woman appears:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-18 07:01:08):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-18 07:02:04):
She is a female damaya lashunta.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-18 07:03:00):
Arta awkwardly says:
"I am Arta, 
I'm an Arcanamirium professor, and you lot look to be heavily armed...
What can I do for you all....?"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-18 08:29:25):
Mausbert is a bit startled, not expecting this to be their appearance and demeanor. 
"Oh- I am Mausbert. Mausbert Gouda, a simple Good Transporter. We wanted to talk with you about the latest Events, like the Scream."
Mausbert takes a deep breath. "For example just recently I found myself suddenly inside the bowels of Absalom as if I had ran through a wormhole. One moment I was running to get to my ship, the next I found myself in the dark depths floating in 0-G."

**Wafflemuncher** (2025-08-18 14:11:40):
Upon hearing Arta; AOC begins to bob excitedly and floats to the forefront of the group with the Ysoki. "Excuse my assertion Mausbert please." Before he focuses on the researcher. "I am known as Arcanamirium Occult Campus for my fascination and research I've done for the institution. It is very well to meet a peer so serendipitously. We would like to discuss a shared vision and sequence of events with you; perhaps you would meet with us in your apartment?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-18 18:42:29):
+1 hero point AOC.

**Wafflemuncher** (2025-08-19 04:19:28):
AOC will turn to address the rest of the group then. "That was an extremely productive conversation. Now if any of you have any suggestions or tangential chores to be done I believe we have some time before the next university meeting. I would like to recommend a night of rest after our trials though if I may."

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-08-19 23:45:55):
"I think we still have some shopping to do and we may want to keep an eye out for bounties or job."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-23 08:53:41):
What do you want to do next?

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-23 21:42:02):
"I think we should head shopping and keep an eye out for whatever unusual may happen."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-24 20:03:48):
"That works too, I think."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-24 20:19:31):
*[image]* Mausbert nods and begins to investigate about Nikk-Nakk on the Infosphere.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:37:14):
You want info on Nikk-Nakk?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 09:37:05):
You find out:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 09:37:12):
Nikk-Nakk is a male ysoki mechanic.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 09:37:27):
Nikk-Nakk was a fairly famous adventurer who retired.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 09:37:45):
Nikk-Nakk grows heirloom tomato plants.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 09:38:32):
Nikk-Nakk loves tomatoes, starships and hates AbadarCorp with a deep passion.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 09:38:58):
Particularly for their pharmaceutical price fixing.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-25 09:59:07):
As Mausbert finds the info that Nikk-Nakk hates the AbadarCorp, he looks down on his clothing that just screams AbadarCorp employee.
"Fuck. Either I need to change my clothes or I can't come in. Nikk-Nakk hates AbadarCorp. But he loves tomatoes."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-25 10:10:55):
"Or, I have another idea." Mausbert pulls out a pen, one he usually uses to sign documents with, and begins to deface the AbadarCorp logos and inscriptures with either just crossing through them, or being a bit more creative and drawing evil faces into the head of the key symbol, or burning money inside the triangle.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-25 10:11:08):
*[image]* (in case that's needed)

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-08-25 10:14:22):
Lysae nods. “A disguise; good thinking. But can you sell the lie? It might be worth practicing talking bad about AbadarCorp.”

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-25 10:39:29):
"I've talked enough with my coworkers."

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-25 10:42:17):
"Don't worry, even if he hates you because you're from abadarcorp he won't be able to resist my ★SUPER IDOL CHARM★"

Livy will cast Glow Up on herself before she get to Nikk Nakk

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-25 15:30:36):
Mausbert follows along towards Nikk-Nakk.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-08-25 15:55:28):
You could also just rip the patches off.  I mean destruction of their property could be scene as a strong hate of them as well.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-26 16:30:03):
(We heading to Nikk-Nakk now?)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-26 16:38:43):
(I'm assuming yes and we use Absolom maps to get there?)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-26 18:12:07):
Or is it abadarmaps?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-26 18:12:39):
The archives of nethys?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-28 09:32:43):
Ok, so you are heading to Nikk-Nakk.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-28 09:34:09):
You come to a junkyard.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-28 09:34:20):
It has a chained fence all around the perimeter.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-28 09:34:24):
There is a buzzer you can ring.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-28 12:14:43):
"Is the proof to bring you some tomatoes?"

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-08-28 16:38:42):
" I doubt fresh produce would be the answer."  To the intercom. "What proof so you need?"

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-08-29 17:25:23):
"Alright then Nikk-Nakk.  Is there a place where potentials jobs may be posted or are we just supposed to help random strangers and hope word gwta back to you?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-31 19:13:07):
Nikk-Nakk continues:
"Do all this and I'll give you the job.
IF and only IF you do the job well, then I'll be sending you on MORE jobs.
Understand?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-31 19:14:59):
Nikk-Nakk continues over the intercom:
"Also, I like the anti-Abadar graffiti on your outfit; it sends a powerful message that the corporations cannot control art."

And you hear Nikk-Nakk play a riff on an electric guitar.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-31 19:28:58):
"Heh, yeah. Fuck them. And understood." 
Mausbert says before turning towards the others. "The Shipyard sounds like a job to my liking. What about you?"
