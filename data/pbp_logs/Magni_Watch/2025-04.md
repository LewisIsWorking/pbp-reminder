**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-05 22:20:37):
Lieutenant Lavarsus awaits the arrival of the leader of the squad and the squads remaining members.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-13 19:08:05):
Lieutenant Lavarsus:
"Your captain is late.
I'm putting on coffee."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-13 19:26:26):
Lieutenant Lavarsus says:
"Lysandra. Nadya.
Coffee?"

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-04-14 01:53:40):
Nadya perks up at the prospect.

"Oh yeah, sure. You have any bloodeye blend?"

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-04-14 02:56:05):
"Ahhh, none required, thanks. They know what they're doing in Kelesh."

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-04-14 03:05:06):
“Nothing for me, thank you.”

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-14 10:27:48):
Lieutenant Lavarsus seems unsatisfied with that answer as he grumbles:
"Fair enough."
The potfox makes your beverages and they are almost perfect, potfoxes make the best drinks!

**Eimer Hone** (2025-04-18 21:43:22):
Zilde EvenGuard runs in. “Apologies for being late. Needed to speak to my father. How is everyone.”

**Eimer Hone** (2025-04-18 21:49:05):
Zilde salutes the Lieutenant. “Sorry sir. Didn’t see you there.@

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 21:56:02):
Lieutenant Lavarsus:
"You might have found the pirate king's treasure but I don't think you are cut out for this job."

**Eimer Hone** (2025-04-18 21:59:21):
“I am. Let me show you. It’s in my blood.”

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-04-18 23:01:51):
"That's a good attitude to have. Thanks for being late by the way, we got a nice little smoke and coffee break for it. Still have a bit of flay if you want, as thanks."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-04-19 05:13:02):
Nadya settles back and takes another drag on her pipe. She gazes out the window but her ears perk up a bit and twist towards the lieutenant to hear better.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-19 23:00:47):
Lieutenant Lavarsus:
"We have crafted for you, special magical badges."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-19 23:01:17):
Lieutenant Lavarsus continues:
"These badges allow you to auto magically fine criminals you catch for their crimes.

IT will take the money straight from their bank accounts."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-19 23:01:39):
Lieutenant Lavarsus:
"DO NOT misuse these.

They should shine when a criminal can be fined."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-19 23:02:10):
Lieutenant Lavarsus:
"Now, Zilde Even-Guard will be leading this group given her....experience."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-19 23:02:42):
Lieutenant Lavarsus:
"Now, go down to the tipsy tengu, it's a bar with a load of fighting going on.

Go play bouncer."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-19 23:02:48):
Lieutenant Lavarsus looks at the group:
"GO NOW."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-19 23:03:06):
Lieutenant Lavarsus adds:
"Oh and I'll be supplying you with ample backup as your ranks drop on and off."

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-04-19 23:07:19):
Lysandra gives an impeccable salute as she turns towards Even-Guard. "After you," she says.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-04-20 00:13:08):
"Head to a bar, end fights. Yeah, alright."

Nadya takes a badge and salutes as well, with somewhat improper form but a respectable amount of energy.  She tucks the badge into an inside pocket of her jacket, steps out and waits until everyone else exits the office.

"This stuff used to be some other poor guard's duty. Anyone else feel like this is a demotion from what you were doing before?"

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-04-21 07:11:57):
"It'll be good to get back down to street level though. That office is awful, so much direct sunlight... egh. I can't remember from the name, but if it's a bar and it's in the city I've probably been in the 'tipsy tengu' before. Anyone gets a bruise or scratch at this place, come see me after. I've got all the elixirs and drugs im supposed to have, and a bunch of stuff that'd get me in prison if I wasn't using it in the name of peace and order or whatever. The good stuff, in other words."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-30 22:26:14):
You go to the tipsy tenth...

**Eimer Hone** (2025-04-30 22:59:41):
Zilde opens the door to the tipsy tenth and looks for the bar keep
