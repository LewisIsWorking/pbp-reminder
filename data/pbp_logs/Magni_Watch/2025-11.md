#04 Magni Watch.

Detective Desdelen "Skinny" Bolera responds to Machiq:
"Hmm.

You're asking how you survived such a curse? 

Well.

The curse seemed to effect 4th rank and lower people.

Some stronger were affected.

Some weaker weren't affected at all.

It could be that the amount of tea consumed affected how strongly or weakly the tea affected individuals. 

It could also be that the curse is affiliated with forms of magic that become more or less effective against people for a variety of reasons. 

.....not you lot.

Far as I can see, you were all affected very badly. 

You're not strong yet, definitely not 4th rank.

Captain Darkmoon says he and General Viole saved you lot. 

James has some talent with magic and you've probably heard of Viole and how powerful they are. 

It took a lot out of them but they saved you all.

Way I see it, you owe them both, big time."

Captain James Darkmoon has a look of relief as he responds to Akuma:
"Good.
I'll check in between missions when I'm free.
Practise in only the smallest of exertions at a time."

Captain James Darkmoon takes a sigh of relief and says:
"Any questions?"

When he asks this question you hear a slight accent creep into his voice, an accent not of Varisia.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-11-03 16:35:11):
Akuma stands there for a moment to really think of a question. He isn't finding any, and he knows there has to be a good one. This sort of topic isn't just an opinion on the weather. His mind is drawing a blank, so he decides to ask the first thing he can think of. 
"So, if it isn't rude to ask, where are you from?"

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-11-03 21:51:31):
"Your accent slip," Akuma continues, "It's not from the region." He attempts to give a reassuring smile. "It was hard to learn Varisian, though it does share a love of similar-sounding words meaning different things as my homeland's language."

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-11-14 02:57:39):
*[image]* Here that check is

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 18:17:11):
This would come as a surprise for many many reasons to Akuma.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 18:18:16):
Mainly because Captain James Darkmoon looks only maybe mid to late 40s.
He already seemed "young" for having Zilde EvenGuard as a daughter; this makes it even more so.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-11-14 18:30:26):
Akuma looks the Captain up and down for a moment, trying to see if he can update his estimate of the man's age. Failing to do so, he decides to leave the topic be for the time being, figuring the Captain would elaborate when he felt comfortable enough to do so.

"Well," he says, "It's an honor to serve under you." Giving a nod when they next meet eyes. "You should seriously get some rest. You look worse than death."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-11-14 19:08:56):
Akuma salutes and leaves the room towards his bed.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 19:27:11):
*Back in the infirmary.*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 19:27:48):
Detective Desdelen Bolera (the half-elven detective wearing a wide-brimmed hat):
"Before you all get some rest, we have a new addition to your team to be introduced....."

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-11-14 19:37:11):
An eight inch tall figure in a dark suit and hat walks beside Detective Bolera. He flaps his wings to get up to the edge of one of the beds before flashing a toothy grin. From this vantage he introduces himself.

"Consulting Detective Báyakan, newly appointed to your service."

The fellows bat like ears twitch slightly. "Normally I wouldn't get involved in official matters. The day to day police work is a little humdrum. You lot have indeed stumbled into something interesting, though. So my eyes and ears are yours until the case is cracked. Other senses as well... But we'll get to that."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-11-14 19:53:35):
"Welcome to the team," Akuma responds as he plops down into the bed he was in when he awoke. The frame creaks loudly from his weight. "I'll try my best not to squish you by accident." 

He looks at Báyakan directly, "but no promises." He smiles playfully at the last part.

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-11-14 20:28:57):
The nyktera continues to grin. "Not to worry. When a sprite chooses to live with tall-men, we get accustomed to our doings being felt more than seen."

 Báyakan seems to listen intently for a moment. Content in familiarizing himself with any magic the team may have upon their persons, he finds a suitable place take his rest while the team recovers. Probably the top of the back of a chair.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-11-14 21:46:28):
From her bed, Nadya raises her head out from the pillows to get a look at the new arrival.

"A bat? The chelaxians that run this damn city are going to think we took down that zoo in order to get rid of competition."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-11-14 21:48:41):
Akuma snort chuckles at the words.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-11-14 22:22:54):
"And I'm not a fox, but try telling that to Lieutenant Lavarsus, if you haven't already."

Nadya buries her head back into the pillows with a grumble.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-11-14 22:23:48):
Akuma sits up seriously and looks over at Nadya. "You're not a fox?"

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-11-14 22:50:00):
From the depths of the pillows emanates the groan of a woman whose fault it is that this topic came up. She lazily pulls herself into a sitting position off the side of the bed. 

"What I am is fucking complicated. I'm a kitsune, through Daikitsu's grace we spirits look like whatever the hells we want. I choose to look like this because when I look human I am more obviously Varisian -  and really the only thing humans hate more than strange foreign foxes is other humans that look vaguely different from them. Of course there's also the part where I was born because my mother fucked a vampire, which I feel the need to stress is an awful idea. Plus, dear father is the last in a long line of wizards dating back thousands of years and somehow all that magic is mixed up in my blood too. Don't ask me how any of this fits together, because I don't have a godsdamned clue myself."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-11-14 22:50:20):
Nadya shrugs.

"If you figure 'fox' sums that up for you, great."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-11-14 23:16:50):
Akuma sheepishly replies, "I was just kidding... But I appreciate you sharing your background." He feels a bit guilty for making her feel like she had to divulge all that information. 

"My mom died to give me life, that's at least what I was told. Don't know my father." He thinks back as best he can, "I honestly don't know too much about my bloodline. I only know the stares of contempt." He smiles a bit. "Ba-Ming never looked at me that way. She was the closest thing I had to a mother." He shakes himself free from his memories and lays his head back down. "Sorry to put you on the spot as a joke."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-11-14 23:27:57):
"oh."

Nadya looks away awkwardly.

"Uh, we... We need to figure out the case so my nerves can calm down."

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-11-15 00:55:38):
Flipping through his own notebook, Báyakan comments idly, "The right clue is unlikely to just wander in this evening. Tomorrow, perhaps. Though it seems more likely that we would wander to it."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-11-17 18:06:13):
Nadya flops back down onto the bed.

"We'll see what the captain has for us tomorrow, I suppose."
