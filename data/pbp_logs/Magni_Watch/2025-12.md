**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-03 09:10:53):
> When the Magni Watch report for duty the next morning, Sergeant Moldun Ollo ushers them into Lieutenant Lavarsus's office.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-03 09:10:57):
>> - The Lieutenant leans against his desk with arms crossed, sizing you up.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-03 09:11:00):
>> - The green-black marks of the soul poisoning are visible on some of your exposed skin. After a moment he grunts.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-03 09:11:02):
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-03 09:11:07):
>> - "Well. You didn't die. Congratulations. Don't let it go to your heads—we've got bigger problems than your brush with the afterlife."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-03 09:11:10):
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus waves at the stacks of papers on his desk:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-03 09:11:13):
>> - "Half the city's filing missing persons reports. Some of it's panic from the garden party—people who collapsed and haven't woken, families who can't find each other in the chaos. But some of these..."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-03 09:11:16):
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus pulls a page:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-03 09:11:19):
>> - "These are from *before* the party. People who vanished weeks ago. And nobody noticed because everyone was too busy with their own problems."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-03 09:11:22):
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus shakes his head in disgust:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-03 09:11:31):
>> - "I've got my best people...no, not you lot...working the Para countess situation, who is currently being held... well you don't need to know that. And we are dealing with the soul poisoning coma cases. But until we figure out what the hells happened at that party, someone else is going to have to shovel all of this."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-03 09:11:34):
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus tosses the stack toward you:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-03 09:11:37):
>> - "It says here you lot reported some missing persons yourselves: a wandering wizard and some randy zookeepers from your first assignment. Well, half the reports on my desk are about the same thing. Now, I can't have my actual detectives chasing down every runt who didn't hold mommy's hand. So instead I'm putting you on it."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-03 09:11:40):
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus continues:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-03 09:11:43):
>> - "Start with the Minkaian Trade House in the Dockway. A whole work crew vanished two nights ago, and the Lantern Lodge architects are screaming loud enough to give my superiors heartburn."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-03 09:11:47):
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus leans forward:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-03 09:11:51):
>> - "Track down these strays and see if there's more here than just a bunch of drunks and runaways. And for Abadar's sake, don't mess it up, or I'll have you investigating the latrines in the holding cells till they shine like the First Vault. Clear?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-03 09:14:24):
> Lieutenant Lavarsus adds:
>> - "Ollo's report says you didn't do too badly at the zoo, minus the Grave Raker being stolen... though I still want to know how that happened. So I'll give you some leeway. But don't make me regret it."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-03 21:22:23):
Akuma's face probably shows some confusion about the last statement, as he does not even know what a Grave Raker is, but he quickly assumes he must have missed that part of the Zoo and salutes the lieutenant.

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-12-04 05:52:50):
Báyakan flaps up to the desk and begins jotting important sounding things down off the stack of pages being presented. Names, locations, and any data related to those missing, mostly. His fangs vanish from sight when the insults regarding actual detectives start. The tiny fellow bites his tongue quite well through that, trying to focus on simply getting the information for the assignment.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 14:23:29):
> Lieutenant Lavarsus stands and opens the door.
>> - "The Trade House is in the Dockway, near the Bazaar of Sails. You can't miss it—it's the half-finished Minkaian building with all the yelling. Now get out of my office."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-09 18:11:02):
Akuma follows orders and steps out of the office.

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-12-09 18:32:39):
Once outside the office and a safe distance down the hall, the bat-like sprite offers quietly.

 "Not sure how many times I can let the cracks about "real detectives" go. It's almost like that Lieutenant of yours wants to provoke someone. He is right that we should look into these missing persons... but the other cases are not just somebody else's problem. My expertise is the details, present.... and past. For example, I would love to ask whatever bottle your wine came out of at the party if it knew anything about the soul poisoning... Even a shoe left behind by someone that was kidnapped may know something, though."

The little fellow does not explain further, but rather flits about. Despite his size, he seems to keep pace, and at times, even outpace people of average speed.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-09 19:27:44):
"Well," Akuma responds, "I am sure we will come across something you can use for your parlor tricks." He gives a half-smile to show he is speaking in jest.

"What sort of things did you learn from your gleaming over the files? Anything specific we should be looking out for?"

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-12-09 19:50:06):
"A month's worth of missing persons amounts to sparse clues about some wizard named Kemeneles, an ice wine merchant out of Iriseni, and some Jalmeri tourists. It's not clear how they're all mixed up in all this. Missing vics run the gamut on age, walks of life, and heritage. No bodies have turned up... but also... no ransoms. A five pack of Minkaian stonemasons are easily the largest group of the missing. Probably why we got directed to the Trade House. It's a guess, but it sounds like they may have been working on the building."

The sprite flutters from time to time to flit on and off of peoples shoulders. When close enough, faint chirps can be heard between words. Something like the mostly out of hearing range clicks actual bats make.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-12-09 20:08:00):
"Koriah seemed to think the party stuff was set up by Korvosans. If little cheliax IS related, we might want to seek out diabolists. Getting those out of the city would be an improvement even if it's not related."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-09 21:12:36):
"Hmm," Akuma responds. "What's so special about the wizard, the merchant, and the tourists?"

He looks towards Nadya, "Do you really think it might be Cheliax?" His head tilts towards the sky, both to stretch his neck and to take in the view for a moment. "Just doesn't feel right to me." He says as he looks forward, "But I can tell you know more about these things than I, so I will keep my eyes peeled for signs of devil worship."

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-12-09 21:14:57):
"What's special about the wizard is in the same category as "is it devil worship..." Which is to say, That's to see. To know we would have to track down signs of the wizard...or the diabolists. Whichever comes first."

The sprite tips his hat a bit by the brim, a gesture that seems to mean it's all the same to him.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-12-09 21:38:02):
"You're the detective. I can see if my ins have leads on devil dens later, it'd probably be quicker if I did it alone anyhow. We may as well head to the trade house."

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-12-10 17:23:38):
Báyakan eyes the golem, but questions the others.

"How accurate is the downlow from the tin can, usually?"

The sprite is clearly curious, but cautious about the assertations of an automaton.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-10 17:31:31):
"That may be the current situation, but if I recall correctly, the captain and the paracountess were in talks when the attack occurred." An audible pop is heard as Akuma rolls his shoulder; he seems unbothered by it.

"Not to say that it wasn't part of her 'grand plan' to bring him away, but I think the captain would be the first person to accuse her of the crime if so."

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-12-10 17:39:47):
Flapping up to Changer's shoulder, he knocks upon the golem's head lightly.

"Where do you come by your information? Sounds like it doesn't quite match up with what the rest have."

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-12-12 17:47:28):
Looking to the other guards, Báyakan questions,

"Official channels rep? Did you guys do something to make the higher ups think you needed watching, at some point?"

He also gets back to moving. The trade house is ultimately the goal. And if the state watchdog golem is a part of that, it will certainly follow no matter what the answer is.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-12 19:26:15):
Akuma simply sighs before saying, "Must be hard to not be able to develop an opinion of your own."

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-12-12 21:18:03):
"That we will all...?"

While the prompting is happening, the fellow takes out a notebook and jots down a possible secondary case to build. At the top of the page he scribbles Internal Affairs.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-12 21:24:32):
"What did you do?" Akuma asks Báyakan. "You broke him." He starts walking around Changer, trying to find a mechanism to open him for potential repair.

"I'd better not get docked pay for this." He jests.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-12-12 22:17:31):
"Pretty sure what he was about to say is that none of us can be trusted, especially if the Lieutenant is the one making the call."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-12-12 22:25:40):
Nadya pauses for a moment.

"Hmm. It, not he, I guess."

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-12-13 13:11:14):
"The opinion of the government sounds like comes from higher up than the Lieutenant's desk."

To the golem, he presses a bit, "Is this official opinion redacted, somehow?"

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-12-13 18:24:42):
"Who all do your "opinions" feed from? It seems clear you're connected magically to...somebody. Probably several somebodies."

More note taking. Facts of what was said, for the moment. Supposition comes later in the process.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-12-14 05:18:05):
"You know, that's good point. The Lord Mayor owned that zoo, so I'm sure he's not happy with us, eh? Even though we saved a bunch of lives, his pet monsters had to be put down."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-17 01:39:41):
> Changer's head tilts slightly, as if listening to something the others cannot hear.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-17 01:39:53):
> Changer:
>> - "I hear many voices."
>> - "They do... They do not always agree."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-17 01:40:10):
> A pause. Longer than natural. Computation. The gears are audibly turning.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-17 01:40:16):
> Changer:
>> - "Lord-Mayor Grobaras provides civic direction."
>> - "Master Toph Bhreacher provides operational parameters."
>> - "The Council of Ushers provides legal framework."
>> - "The Sin....."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-17 01:40:32):
> Changer stops. His eyes flicker, a faint light pulses behind the glass of his eye sockets.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-17 01:40:35):
>> - ".... sincere hopes of Magnimar's leadership guide my purpose."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-17 01:40:54):
> Another pause. When he speaks again, his tone is unchanged, but the words feel heavier. Like he is considering each and every word.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-17 01:40:58):
>> - "But on one matter, there is consensus."
>> - "Magnimar must be protected. From threats without. From threats within."
>> - "Korvosa is the primary external threat. This is not disputed."
>> - "You are not currently classified as an internal threat."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-17 01:41:03):
> Changer's head turns toward the Dockway.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-17 01:41:21):
>> - "This is good."
>> - "The Minkaian Trade House is 1.7 miles northeast. Estimated walking time: 21.67 minutes."
>> - "Korvosan agents have operated in the Dockway before."
>> - "Remain vigilant.

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-12-17 09:06:20):
Smiling outwardly, Báyakan follows along. To the other flesh and blood folk, he says cheerfully, "Good to know we are not, currently, classified as an internal threat. Nothing ominous about that at all. Absolutely no sense in looking into any of that at any soon point."

Though he himself could likely shave time off that twenty minute walk, he keeps steady pace behind the golem.

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-12-17 14:29:38):
Laughing, the sprite nods along genuinely happily with the news reel feed. While some of it seems to be news to him, he stops for a brief moment to check himself for thus far unknown signs of being affected by the mana poisoning.

"Pretty sure my transfer came a little late to have been stricken with the illness. Studying those that were up close was actually one of my motivations to be here in the first place. The rest of what you're describing is just why my people even have a presence in Magnimar... The city is so fascinating. Always some calamity, magical or political or both going on."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-17 17:03:10):
When Changer mentions the 1,000 people, Akuma glances at the pauldron of his uniform, confirming it covers the mark left from the attack.

"Are the two Amar's the same person? Or is it just a common name in these parts?" He asks.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-17 21:17:22):
Akuma nods like he understands, but he most certainly does not. "So, if patterns are a thing, there's a fifty-fifty chance that he's still alive."

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-12-18 05:20:00):
"Should we chance upon this Amar, remind me to ask how one recovers from disintegration. Effectively dead is quite a turn of phrase. Distinct from actually dead."

During the walk, the sprite jots down a few more notes, settling on the question, Why is Changer tasked with keeping tabs on the MagniWatch? A small mystery this might be, but it seems worth checking into... at least until something more interesting comes along.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-18 16:46:57):
Akuma shrugs playfully, "Just noting that it hadn't stopped him before. Bet he has some great tales." He looks around the area, trying to not let the welcome distraction be too distracting.

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-12-18 17:10:30):
After pursuing this strange lead, Báyakan gets his eyes back up as well. To the suggestion of being resurrected despite being distinegrated, he whistles a little.

"Sounds expensive. Sign me up for that guy's insurance plan."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-23 00:58:05):
Changer: 
"Are we ready to PROCEEEED?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-26 16:18:56):
Changer pauses.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-26 16:19:14):
Changer stops walking. His eyes flicker with a purple arcane glow.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-26 16:19:29):
Changer:
"Incoming directives."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-26 16:19:40):
Changer:
"Additional personnel assigned to Magni Watch effective immediately."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-26 16:20:22):
Changer:
"Rendezvous point: Dockway entrance, northeast corner."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-26 16:20:49):
Changer:
"Description: unknown. He will be wearing a Magni Watch uniform"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-26 16:20:52):
Changer:
"Integration priority: High. we could use more help."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-26 16:20:55):
@RyoYamakawa

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-26 16:42:21):
"Well, let's go pick up our new companion." Akuma responds and hastens his pace towards the Dockway.

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-12-26 17:40:50):
"Transfers to work the interesting cases seem to be common."

The detective zips about, mostly following the others. His pacing seems erratic, but he does not slow the others down.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-12-26 21:08:48):
"Another addition to the zoo, hopefully. I wonder what this one fucked up to get thrown in with us."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-26 21:50:43):
Akuma stops briefly at Nadya's last statement, "Wait. I thought this was a promotion." He continues moving, "Is this not a promotion?"

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-12-26 22:22:39):
Nadya barks out a laugh but it doesn't sound particularly mirthful.

"Promotion? Gods above, what were you doing before this?"

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-26 23:04:39):
Akuma replies meekly, "Parking tickets..."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-12-26 23:21:24):
Nadya stops with Akuma, this clearly needs to be sorted out before continuing.

"I watched you cast a spell of holy light earlier. It didn't look like the first time. And they had you handing out legal citations?"

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-26 23:33:02):
"I wasn't on the best of terms with my previous supervisor." Akuma lets out a soft sigh, "I accidentally scared him in front of the rest of the squad... He... uh... " It takes a few moments to find the next set of words, "... relieved? Yeah, relieved himself during the briefing."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-12-26 23:43:05):
"Wow okay, yeah. Congratulations on the promotion."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-12-26 23:43:42):
"Hopefully it's a promotion for this new one too, I guess."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-26 23:44:38):
Change:
"Insufficient detail for processing."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-12-26 23:44:52):
"Please don't."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-26 23:47:44):
Akuma takes an intentional step away from Changer, his face clearly showing disgust. He mutters only one word as he continues his way towards the Dockway, "pervert..."

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-12-26 23:57:46):
Báyakan laughs at the exchange enough to need to wipe his eyes. And then again when the tin can encourages a more vivid description.

"Guess we'll see if this other new recruit also frightened the fluids out of their commanding officer."

Barely containing himself at the idea of a golem deliberately being a pervert, the little fellow shakes his head.

"Suppose we'll see if they consider this a step up or down as well."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-27 02:58:17):
You party watch as the heroes of Magnimar go past in a carriage, going from the dockway disctrict, to the Naos district.

They do not notice the Magni Watch.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-27 05:32:40):
> The party arrives at the Dockway entrance, northeast corner.

> A figure in a Magni Watch uniform is waiting—though "figure" might be generous. They're barely over two feet tall, scales shimmering aqua and plum in the morning light. Crystal piercings catch the sun from their nose and eyebrow. Their uniform has been... accessorized. Colorful scarves, mismatched buttons, what appears to be a tiny suncatcher dangling from their belt.

> They smell, inexplicably, like fresh cinnamon rolls.

> The kobold waves enthusiastically.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-27 05:32:42):
@RyoYamakawa

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-27 06:17:50):
Kitt whistles a cheerful little sea shanty as they wait for their new team? squad? They tilt their head as they try to figure out the right word, not losing focus on the melody. As they were distracted by their thoughts they almost missed seeing some figures wearing the distinctive Magni Watch colors approaching. With a big smile Kitt starts jumping up and down, waving their arms. Their jewelry swings and sparkles in the sun as they excitedly try to catch their attention.

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-12-27 06:26:43):
Appraising the kobold for but a moment or two, Báyakan nods to Nadya, "Promotion for this one, for certain."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-12-27 06:38:23):
"Mhm. That kind of enthusiasm doesn't tend to come with experience in the force."

Nadya lazily waves back to the kobold. She winces a little every time the sun is reflected into her eyes.

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-12-27 08:24:50):
The diminutive detective utters a brief incantation in fey, and then zips off the last fifty feet or so towards the kobold. A couple flaps of his wings bring him up enough to land lightly upon the bejeweled kobold's shoulder. With a tip of his hat, he introduces himself,

"Consulting Detective Báyakan. And who might you be there?"

Even while speaking, the sprite seems to be conducting an up close examination of whatever metal seems shiny.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-27 21:17:34):
"Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Kitt, oh right I keep forgetting ranks. They always get angry at me for that. I'm Inspector Kitt of the Chaplains Unit."

They laugh which makes their nickel and gold jewelry shake and reflect the light.

"Oh wow, I've never met anyone smaller than me. Wait, that's really rude. I'm sorry, I hope you can forgive me." The kobold mood quickly shifts from excitement to remorse.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-28 00:21:47):
Kitt tilts their head at the strange question, their tongue sticking out of their muzzle a bit as they consider it.

"Hmm, I don't think so. I mean, we're supposed to be working to make sure people and the city are safe, right? As long as we're doing that nothing's really changed."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-29 01:48:23):
Changer:

"Onward, to the trade house. PROCEED."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-29 01:48:37):
The group will now arrive at the trade house...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-29 01:54:42):
This street in the dockway, not too far from the ocean is busy on one side with shops and pubs and all sorts of businesses.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-29 01:54:53):
The other side of this street is dominated by a large construction site.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-29 01:55:35):
It is surrounded by tall red walls that just barely conceal the unfinished 1st floor above a mostly finished ground floor of a Tian-Xia tower.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-29 01:56:19):
Anyone with Magnimar lore will know that one day this ambitious project will be a HUGE 7 floor tower (ground, 1,2,3,4,5 and 6).

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-29 01:56:25):
Right now it is a construction site.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-29 01:56:29):
One that is in chaos.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-29 01:57:55):
There are builders, Tian-Xia guards, project planners, cooks, labourers and other kind of person running around the site, yelling at one another to find a solution.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-29 01:58:25):
This chaotic mess is centred like a hurricane around this woman:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-29 01:58:36):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-29 01:59:13):
Many groups of people are trying to get her attention and she is trying to split her time but failing due to everyone yelling over each other.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-29 04:01:10):
What next? :)

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-12-29 08:40:06):
"Wonderful style. Gokan, maybe? Certainly not Songainese, too high of a plan. Anyway..."

Nadya calls out to try to get the attention of the woman.

"Magniwatch, we need to talk!"

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-12-29 12:13:23):
The nyktera zips about, evading various people that simply do not see him. After a few instances of this, he seems to resign himself to standing under the feet of the other Magniwatch guards. While Nadya tries to get the lady's attention, he almost habitually releases a magic detecting pulse. This just seems to be part of his standardized introduction process.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-29 23:08:54):
Akuma squats and pats the kobold on the shoulder before heading into the chaos, "Welcome to the team." 

He uses his large frame to more or less push others aside, clearing a path, even if it is momentary, toward the woman.

**Wren** (2025-12-30 15:47:42):
Seeing the promised backup of other Magniwatch agents, a hunched figure stops its unmoving observation of the ongoing chaos from their discreet watchpost among the construction equipment, and starts moving through the panicked crowd to catch up with the others. On the first glance this person is clearly some sort of a limestone gargoyle or an automaton that sprang to life, with a pair of bat-like wings, a spike ended tail and a head sculptured into a visage that of a wyvern/bat like beast. As it moves closer, trying awkwardly to push its way forward with its wings, you can see that it is wearing a Magniwatch uniform that had been visibly modified to fit their unusual form. As it catches up it introduces itself in a deep low voice with a distinct gnomish accent:
,,Hey! I am so glad that I can finally see other officers here. I was sent to guard this place but then suddenly all hell broke loose and it feels too much to deal with alone!”

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-30 15:55:24):
Akuma, initially so focused on getting to the woman in the center of the crowd, jumps half a meter away from this winged creature made of what appears to be stone, probably knocking over a person or two.

"Sun Wukong!" He shouts as a sort of swear at his surprise. Once he takes a good look at the uniform he straightens himself up and helps up anyone he may have shoved down on accident. "Sorry..." He mutters as he does so.

He then gives this unusual individual his attention, "Uh, yeah, happy to help. What's the situation? Do you know?" He asks.

**Wren** (2025-12-30 16:21:28):
The creature nervously scratches their stony chin, and looks rather sorry at the scene they caused. They look up at the Akuma and mutter:
,,Please don't tell the higher ups, but I got distracted looking at the sky and suddenly everybody started shouting. I don't know what happened here, but I am sure that she knows something! She is some kind of authority of this project."                                                           They point at the tired woman with the tip of their tail.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-30 16:33:22):
Akuma does let out a brief sigh before placing a firm hand on the stoney creature's shoulder, "Well, let's get those answers." He removes his hand and continues to gently shove his way through the crowd.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-12-30 20:18:43):
Nadya observes the interaction with a cold stare. Eventually she turns away, muttering "One thing at a time."

She pulls an ampoule out of a belted pouch on her hip and cracks it open directly into her mouth with a practiced motion, and the liquid seems to cause her visage and figure to morph ever so slightly. She then summons an illusory gonging sound a few feet above her. The ringing sound continues every few seconds as the party continues to try to get the attention of the woman supposedly in charge.

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2025-12-30 20:31:50):
Keeping up with the other guards as they work their way through the crowd Báyakan again takes an oddly spaced step and murmurs softly in fae. Images of arcane eyes flash briefly upon his shoes, and when he flaps them, his wings, as he uses his size to move under the crowd. At least until he's in a position to flap up onto the popular lady's shoulder. Flashing a badge at quite close range, he hails again,

"Pretty sure the ringing over there is because the rest of the Magniwatch would like to have a word about missing persons here..."

Pointing, he tries to direct the bespectacled lady's attention to the other guards.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-30 20:34:40):
Akuma, noticing Báyakan pointing at their group, raises a hand and waves.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-31 00:25:43):
"Very quick on the wing, that they are." Kitt chuckles as they squirm their way through the crowd with the others.
