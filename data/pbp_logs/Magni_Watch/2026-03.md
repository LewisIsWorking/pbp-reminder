## Week 9 (Feb 23–Mar 01)

### 📅 Sunday, Mar 01

*[image]* Nadya grumbles quietly to herself in diabolic; "If this kobold blows us up I am going to personally drag them back up through all nine hells to face justice here before I throw them back in the pit."

But she raises her hands, empty, and takes a step to the side.

"Calm yourself, kid. I like my current inner body temperature, I can yell across the room without getting closer. I suspect you don't want to die either, so can we talk?"

**Cannon McMahon** (2026-03-01 00:32:38):
While she moves slowly to the side and away from the rest of the party, she shoots a subtle message spell to them;

< I can probably keep them talking, but a backup plan from someone would be nice. >

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:44:00):
You got a 17 on your diplomacy check then hero point rerolled into a 28.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:44:05):
*That's definitely a critical success.*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:46:43):
The kobold's grip on the detonator loosens. 

Just a fraction.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:46:58):
Female kobold:

"I... I don't want to die."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:47:13):
The female kobold continues:
"Rekarek said guard the room. Pull the switch if anyone comes through the front. She said it would be easy."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:47:41):
The female kobold says in a more high pitched voice:
"Nobody said anything about people coming through the CEILING."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:48:19):
She lowers the detonator to her side. 

Not dropping it. 

But not threatening with it either.

Female kobold:
"What... what.. what will happen to me if I put this down?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:48:29):
Female kobold says quietly:
"I don't want to die...."

**Cannon McMahon** (2026-03-01 02:06:36):
Nadya takes an experimental step forward.

"Listen, I've been in your position before. Back when I was a kid, I also got put in front of the one calling the shots when we had our backs against the wall. If I let myself die then, I wouldn't have lived seven of those lifetimes since then. Trust me, you've got a lot of stuff to live for. Rekarek gave you a switch to blow yourself up, which disqualifies them from being worth blowing yourself up over. What's your name?"

**Cannon McMahon** (2026-03-01 02:06:47):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:30:52):
*You got a natural 1 which totals to a 10 then you hero pointed that into a reroll of 26.*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:31:03):
*That'll be another critical success, I think.*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 23:20:32):
The kobold's lip trembles.
She puts the detonator on the ground.
Doopa:
"Doopa."
She sniffs.
Doopa:
"My name is Doopa."
She sits down on the tile floor, hugging her knees.
Doopa:
"This was supposed to be my first real job. Rekarek said I was ready. Skerix said I was too young but Rekarek doesn't listen to Skerix about anything."
She looks up at Nadya.
Doopa:
"You really were like me?"
