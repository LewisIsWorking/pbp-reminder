Is that the end of your turn ?

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-03 03:47:46):
*[image]* Gauging the situation, Akuma dashes behind the thief.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-03 03:49:38):
*[image]* He almost forgot to use the dull side of his blade, and readjusted his aim in mid-swing, making his blow ineffective.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-03 03:51:01):
*[image]* He tries to catch her on the backswing, but was unable to make contact. Akuma is clearly frustrated with himself.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-03 03:51:33):
That ends his turn.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-03 04:01:54):
*[image]* (Due to the poor memory of hero points, this modifies the first attack)
Even though Akuma was ill prepared in his stance, he found resolve in his deep desire to make a good first impression and focused greater, allowing him to strike a heavy blow on the theif!

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-03 04:02:11):
Rerolled with the hero point on first attack, end of turn.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-03 04:11:24):
*[image]* After taking 13 points of damage from your CRITICAL Katana slash to the back, the thief is looking a bit rough, blood seeping through her leather armour!

The thief grits her teeth, not quite yet willing to surrender and whirls around to attack her new opponent: you, Akuma!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 01:02:28):
@MrNegetZ is doing the Foundry side of @HistoricallyInaccurate's turn.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 01:08:15):
Zilde EvenGuard ignites her longsword with a whispered prayer to Iomedae .

Magical holy fire explodes along the steel.

Zilde EvenGuard strikes the female thief.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 01:08:22):
The Strike deeply wounds her

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 01:08:26):
and she surrenders.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 01:08:46):
The large man catches up with the group.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 01:09:16):
The merchant gets his belongings back.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 01:09:24):
And your badges begin to glow again!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 01:09:55):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 01:10:12):
22 gold is fined from the woman and added to the group's bank account.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 01:11:04):
*[image]* I've also added the 30 GP from the last encounter.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 01:12:18):
*[image]* Her weapons and armour all glow, disappear from her body and appear in the party bank vault.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 01:12:40):
Now in plain clothes the woman swears then walks off to the nearest hospice to receive healing.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 01:12:57):
The merchant thanks the group then also walks off.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-07-07 01:15:16):
"I wish they would all just run into my arm like that. Makes this way easier."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 01:16:04):
You receive a telepathic message from Lieutenant Grospek Lavarsus’s:
"What are you doing waiting around for?
There are skeletons coming out of the sea and attacking dock workers!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 01:16:30):
The party rushes to the dock where 4 skeletons are in fact attacking dock workers, who are running for their lives.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 01:17:20):
The skeletons wear rusted armour covered in seaweed.

They also wield rusted broken swords.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 01:19:17):
Akuma with TWENTY SEVEN (!) in initiative wins the check!

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-07 02:21:26):
As the party rushes to the docks, they meet a blue(?) man on the way also rushing there. His skin slightly blending in with the custom uniform of the magniwatch looking more like a martial art attire than an actual uniform, and you also notice the badge of the magniwatch on his belt.
He greets you with a Tian accent:
" Oh, hello there, are you guys also going to the docks to deal with the skeletons? I guess i should introduce myself. Gijo is my given name. I seem to have been late for the roll call. This city is very new to me so i was lost in it's streets. The Lieutenant assigned me to the same duties as yous even though i was supposed to be training people in the way of traditional Tian martial arts here... so nice to meet you all."

As the party approaches the skeletons he readies himself:
"Let me be in the front."

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-07 03:05:23):
Gijo readies himself and enters his stance(1 action)
He moves up between the 2 skeletons on the bottom(1 action stride)
And strikes it with a flurry of attacks(1 action furry of blows)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-07 03:05:49):
*[image]* (only 1 hit)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 03:21:00):
3 remain.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-07-07 06:35:58):
Nadya will stay back and just rip a 3 action force barrage on a single skeleton.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-07-07 06:36:01):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-08 01:39:33):
The skeletons seem like they hit hard but are not durable!

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-08 02:36:39):
*[image]* Akuma darts into the middle of the group and swings wildly at one of the undead creatures, missing.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-08 02:39:32):
*[image]* On his second swing, he almost lost the grip on his blade entirely. He pulls himself into the swing, opening up for a counter in order to maintain his grip and was able to land a solid blow on the fiend.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-08 02:40:02):
End of Akuma's turn.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-08 03:11:15):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-08 03:11:17):

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-09 00:20:40):
Lysandra gallops forward, blades drawn as she barrels towards the unharmed skeleton. She slashes at it with the longsword, bringing the flyssa around to carve through the bones if it tries to dodge the bigger sword (Twin Feint).

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-09 00:21:38):
*[image]* The longsword cleaves into the skeleton's skull.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-09 00:23:10):
*[image]* The flyssa probably misses even with the skeleton off-guard (I'm assuming because I doubt it will automatically apply the off-guard from Twin Feint).

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-09 00:45:31):
All skeletons destroyed.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-09 00:45:34):
COMBAT OVER.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-09 00:45:39):
+1 Hero Points to the group.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-09 00:46:07):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-09 00:49:44):
*[image]* Ocean Skeleton looted added.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-09 00:53:07):
The party don't have much time to think before they see a massive firework go BOOM in the sky.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-09 00:53:17):
It says:

"G U A R D S."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-09 00:53:24):
In BRIGHT purple colours.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-09 00:53:34):
The party follow this to a local magic shop.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-09 00:54:11):
The shop is called "Porphyry's Equipment for Evokers."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-09 00:54:47):
A woman in a floppy, wide-brimmed wizard hat comes outside the door, arms crossed and tapping her foot impatiently.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-09 00:55:16):
Marin Porphyry:

"I'm Marin Porphyry and you lot took your time, hmm? Not obvious enough?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-09 00:55:22):
Marin Porphyry points at the fireworks.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-07-09 01:39:17):
"Why's the kid scared? Something happen?"

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-09 17:02:24):
Akuma just stands by, obvious bewilderment painted across his face. He thinks to himself, Did she say 'drop him'?

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-07-09 22:58:46):
Nadya seems like she has more questions but sighs and turns to the rest of the party.

"I can go in and try to talk this kid down from... whatever they're planning. It would probably be bad form to get in a fight with a child."

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-09 23:43:12):
"Probably. Diplomacy is not my strength. Call for help if you need it, and I can knock him out."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-07-10 01:36:03):
Nadya sniffs back an irritated remark and mixes together a quick social mutagen. She steps up to the door of the shop's door and calls inside.

"Hey! You hear me from in there? My name is Nadya, I want to talk."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 06:16:10):
The door appears to have been jammed with magic glue.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 06:16:56):
Breaking down the door requires a successful DC 15 Athletics check. 

The windows, unlocked, are another entry option but it will shatter the window.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 06:17:16):
Eunice:
"I'm....I'm not coming out."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 06:17:35):
Eunice's voice breaks in the middle.

He has the voice of a puberty stricken young boy.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-07-11 06:47:45):
"Yeah, that's fine. Like I said, I'm just trying to talk to you. Are you hurt in there or anything? I'm a trained alchemist, perhaps I can help you!"

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-07-11 07:01:54):
(Silently Nadya casts a message spell to the party passing on the information about the door.)

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-07-11 23:52:01):
"Why dont you tell me more about what happened? Do you have any family in the city we can get?"

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-07-12 02:34:32):
"Yeah, I don't have any family around here either. Is it alright if I come in so we can talk a little easier?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:07:46):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:08:22):
Gijo starts talking to Viole.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:10:18):
Viole starts talking down the boy.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:11:45):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:11:49):
Success...barely.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:12:18):
Eunice drops his wand and the badges of the Magni Watch begin to GLOW.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:12:27):
+1 Hero Point to all Magni Watchers and Viole!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:12:42):
And with that Eunice's dagger is fined from him and added to the party stash.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:16:02):
As Marin Porphyry reluctantly thanks the Magni-Watch, Sergeant Ollo arrives!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:18:19):
Sergeant Ollo:
"Watchers! Watchers!

Some of Magnimar's zoo creatures have managed to escape and are terrorising not only the zoo’s visitors but also surrounding businesses.

It’s up to the agents of Magni watch to put things right as quickly as possible and then report back!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:18:53):
Sergeant Ollo despite his senior age is not exhausted but you can tell he is itching for his next nap.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:19:43):
Sergeant Ollo then looks at Haku and Viole and says:
"Uhhh, who are.... I know you, looking at Viole.
I'd heard another tiefling had joined the heroes of Magnimar."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:20:45):
Viole:
"I am Viole.
I heard from this child that someone took his master."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:21:51):
Sergeant Ollo:
"Well, I'll file a report back at the Arvensoar.
I'll make sure that's followed up on.

I know the heroes of Magnimar normally deal with BIG issues but...if you have time."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:21:59):
Viole:
"If I have to."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:22:07):
Sergeant Ollo:
"No no, if you can."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:22:19):
Haku flies down.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:22:21):
@Askarans

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:22:37):
Haku introduces himself and Sergeant Ollo introduces himself.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:25:30):
*[image]* Zoo map

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:25:33):
^ Zoo map.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:26:13):
You run to the zoo.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:26:28):
As you arrive at the entrance you find yourselves in a Marketplace.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:27:03):
Tents, wagons, and carpets displaying goods for sale define a small marketplace just outside the zoo’s fence. 

Panicked merchants shout from behind wagon doors or tightly closed tent flaps. 

On one of the carpets, a lifesized statue of a merchant wraps its arms around an array of fine vases, as if trying to protect them from something. 

Several other small rugs and pillows have been piled haphazardly in the market’s center, around which stalks a strange creature resembling a batwinged chicken screeching challenges.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:27:15):
Society check.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:27:19):
For the group.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:27:31):
Or Magnimar lore.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:28:51):
Haku and Viole don't follow.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:29:20):
But Sergeant Ollo promises Viole that Sergeant Ollo will tell Viole when they find out what happened to Eunice's master.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:29:33):
*[image]* Eunice thanks Viole with a hug.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 04:29:38):
@Ltviolejuegrace

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-12 16:32:34):
Everything is happening in a blur. Although Akuma knew that Magnimar was a busy and troubled city, he didn't think it was this hectic. 

"Is this normal?" He asks the group as they arrive to this scene of chaos. He notices the moving statue, it doesn't look like an immediate threat. The bird-like creature, however, very obviously looks like its searching for its next meal. He draws his weapon in preparation.

"And I'm not just talking about the zoo."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-07-12 19:19:47):
"Are cities not normally like this? I've only ever lived here, and in the middle of nowhere where the opposite is the problem and I'm bored out of my mind."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-07-12 19:21:39):
She tosses a numbing tonic to Akuma casually, also observing the chicken monster with consternation.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-12 19:33:16):
Catching the tonic, doing his best to keep his eyes on the threat in front of him, Akuma responds. 

"Vandals; normal. Thieves; also normal. Skeletons? Not unheard of but out of place. Missing wizard? Seems odd. Now a zoo has lost control of their beasts..." He sighs for a moment. "Just seems like a lot."

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-12 19:43:04):
"The last two days have been like this. We must restore law and order to the city."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 22:11:43):
A robot made of stone appears.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 22:12:15):
Changer:
"I am Changer.

Defence golem.

I have been assigned to help with this task."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 22:13:02):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 22:13:27):
The same stone that the Irespan itself is made of.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 22:13:54):
The same stone that the monuments of the city of monuments are shaped from.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-12 22:14:40):
Changer:
"Certain developments abroad have resulted in an enhanced mission statement for his group."

Changer rumbles for a few moments:
"If mission parameters are cleared."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-12 23:40:58):
Akuma looks at this golem that appears and then glances to the vial in his hand to confirm that he had not consumed it yet. His stance drops as he blankly looks at Changer.

"So... this happened yesterday too?" He asks Lysandra.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-13 13:07:30):
“Personally, I’m fine with killing this abomination, but I suppose we should try returning it to the zoo. Preferably unconscious.”

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-15 14:12:28):
"The cockatrice might be too much for us to handle, maybe we should let the golem deal with it while we focus on securing the area"

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-15 15:09:03):
“Hmm… we were told multiple beasts escaped. We should find the remainder.”

**Eimer Hone** (2025-07-17 10:12:11):
is it dead?

**Eimer Hone** (2025-07-17 10:16:43):
Zilde smiles with a hint of disappointment in her eyes

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-17 12:38:05):
Lysandra moves up to flanking position with Zilde as she gauges the beast and designates it as her prey. She cleaves down on it's prone form with her longsword.

*[image]* Taking advantage of the situation, Akuma darts onto the other side of the monstrous bird and slashes at it.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-21 17:01:52):
*[image]* Unfortunately, some blood splattered towards his face, making his second strike go too high to inflict any real damage.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-21 17:03:36):
That's the end of my turn. I have reactive strike as well if it attempts to rise. I'm not sure if you want me to "preemptively" roll that.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 09:24:51):
The Magni Watch have little time to rest.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 09:25:06):
As a scream is heard at the Magnimar Zoo's snack shop.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 09:26:01):
The party enters the snack shop to see the shopkeeper, a female elf with a name badge that says: Emmaline Greengold.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 09:27:01):
The inside of this snack shop is a mess of smashed fruit, spilled vegetables, crushed pop corn, half-eaten hot dogs and melted ice cream with overturned bins and shelves scattered across the floor. 

A counter runs across the south end of the shop, guarding a narrow door to a back room. 

On the north side of the space, a huge shaggy beast with a cruelly hooked beak tears apart a display of gold wine-melons.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 09:27:18):
Emmaline Greengold:
"GUARDS! GUARDS!
Finally!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 09:27:41):
Emmaline Greengold:
"Hoots the Owlbear is going to eat it all!"

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-22 12:52:48):

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-22 13:04:40):

9 & 13 damage.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-22 13:07:03):
Woohoo!

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-22 16:31:39):
*[image]* Akuma, gripped by fear, takes a blow from the large beast. The strike brings Akuma back to the reality of the situation, and despite his quivering hands, he moves around to the creature's flank. He quickly slashes and pushes through his fear to ensure a deep strike.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-22 16:32:56):
*[image]* Seeing his first strike land, he lands another in the same location, hoping to increase the severity of the wound.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-22 16:33:46):

The owl bear is unconscious.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-26 05:43:45):
Akuma kneels next to the creature and gives it a few comforting strokes through its feathers. "Rest well. Hopefully you will be in a more comfortable and familiar locale when you awaken."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-26 12:21:55):
And you see from your position in the shop, the doors of the zoo's black smith bursts open!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-26 12:22:25):
And those of you with society will recognise Rusty the Rust Monster chewing on the zoo's metalwork!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-26 12:23:49):
The dwarf, armed in pretty decent (level 5ish) magical weapons & armour is *trying* to handle this, pushing Rusty back.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-26 12:42:39):
But he's either going to get himself killed or rusty.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-26 13:00:03):
Yet this Black Smith's store isn't the only store it has attacked so far. Out from a corner comes a ratfolk wearing a leather apron running, wielding an odd looking gun which style looks like nothing you have seen before, and a buckler in the other hand.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-26 13:33:34):
"You bastard thing! You ate all my guns!"

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-26 16:45:26):
Seeing the angry ratfolk Gijō will try to reasure them 
"Do not worry member of the public, i will make sure it gets the correction it deserves."
Turning towards the party he'll say: 
"This monster might be harder to deal with for those with metal equipement. I will try to stop it from moving as it is less dangerous to organic material."
Gijō will stand in front of the party ready to jump on the creature and immobilize it.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-26 18:10:46):
Akuma looks at his metal katana, the one given to him from his friend and mentor, and puts it into it's sheath. He then does his best to hide it away from the monster's sight while Gijō moves up to it.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-07-26 18:19:52):
"I've got mutagens for this, as it turns out. Anyone who wants to bite or claw at this thing instead of losing your gear, raise a hand."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-26 19:59:25):
Pointing at his horns with his thumb, Akuma replies, "I appreciate the offer, but I really should dust these things off."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-07-26 22:28:03):
Nadya flashes her fangs and nods approvingly.

"The easiest weapons to smuggle into a club are the ones you're always wearing."

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-07-27 12:34:14):
Lysandra looks between the monster and her metal weapons. With a sigh, she raises her hand.

(I got ahead of myself and started moving in the middle of Askeran's turn, so if the attack was after Get 'Em, then there should be 1 more damage)
