**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-05-01 02:38:56):
Nadya follows along but looks instead for a nice dark corner to sit.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-05-01 02:50:12):
Lysandra steps into the bar, "accidentally" bumping into the doorframe because of her size, and just happening to draw attention to her... and the twin blades sheathed at her side. She looks around for any sign of impending trouble.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-01 07:33:27):
The late afternoon sun casts long shadows across Magnimar's Shore as your Magi Watch patrol exits the administrative offices at the base of the Avensoar. The ancient monument—a massive, partially ruined stone spire—dominates this corner of the Lowcleft district, its weathered surface a testament to the city's mysterious past. 

Your new uniforms still feel stiff against your skin, the leather not yet broken in, the weight of responsibility as fresh as the polished magical badges marking you as Magnimar's newest guardians.

Lieutenant Lavarsus, a stern-faced human whose decades of service are etched into the lines around his eyes, gives your patrol a final once-over. "Remember, you represent Magnimar itself, not just its laws," she states flatly, his voice carrying the weight of command. "I expect this disturbance to be handled with appropriate force—nothing more, nothing less." With a curt nod, she dismisses you to your first real assignment.

It's a short walk through the bustling streets of Lowcleft, past street performers entertaining crowds with sleight-of-hand tricks and vendors hawking everything from spiced meats to dubious "authentic" Thassilonian trinkets. The district pulses with energy—theaters, gambling halls, and taverns line the winding streets, their doors open to welcome locals and travelers alike. Music spills from doorways, competing with the calls of merchants and the general hum of conversation.

The Tipsy Tengu is nestled between a Varisian fortune-teller's shop and a cobbler specializing in "adventurer-grade" footwear. Even from half a block away, you hear the commotion spilling out onto the street—shouting, wild laughter, and the unmistakable sound of breaking glass.

The tavern itself stands three stories tall, constructed of honey-colored stone and dark timber that stands out among the older, weathered buildings of Lowcleft. Ornate lanterns flank a polished oak door bearing a freshly engraved copper plaque. Above, a wooden sign swings gently in the breeze, depicting a tipsy tengu—a bird-like humanoid figure—raising an oversized mug in celebration.

Pushing through the door, the noise intensifies tenfold. The spacious main hall reveals vaulted ceilings with Varisian-style chandeliers hanging overhead. Tapestries depicting scenes from Magnimarian history adorn walls of exposed stone, their corners now sadly splashed with what appears to be spilled wine. The polished wooden floor is littered with overturned chairs, shattered glassware, and puddles of various beverages.

In the center of this chaos stands a motley group of adventurers: a dwarven bruiser wearing a horned helmet adorned with what appear to be authentic ettin teeth, a disheveled elf in wine-stained blue robes, a human in dented armor emblazoned with the foaming mug symbol of Cayden Cailean, and a nimble halfling in studded leather who seems to be juggling silverware even amidst the argument.

They're shouting at a distressed female halfling behind the bar—presumably Belberry—whose elegant green waistcoat and carefully styled hair speak of someone whose day began with much higher hopes. Behind her, frightened serving staff peek out from the kitchen door, while a few well-dressed patrons cower at the far corner tables.

"Ah, there you are!" A well-dressed half-elf near the entrance rises to greet you. His clothing—a perfectly tailored suit of deep purple with gold embroidery—marks him immediately as a resident of the Summit. He carries an ornate cane topped with a sapphire, and his bold blue eyes assess your patrol with relief. His slightly pointed ears and fine features reveal his mixed heritage, though he carries himself with the confidence of Magnimar's upper class. "Magnimar's finest, come to deliver us from these troublemakers!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-01 07:33:36):
The half-elf approaches with a graceful stride, lowering his voice to a conspiratorial whisper that somehow carries over the din. "Honestly, I'd never allow their sort into my hotel, but poor Belberry thought they'd add some local color to her establishment, and they certainly have." His breath carries the scent of expensive brandy as he extends a manicured hand. "Hendrid Pratchett, proprietor of the Dreaming Palace up in the Summit. This is my associate, Ralso."

He indicates a half-orc woman standing nearby, whose formal attire cannot quite disguise her fighter's build. A thin scar runs along her jawline, and her amber eyes miss nothing as she offers your group a curt nod.

"We thought we'd come down and enjoy a quiet evening before tomorrow's opening-day festivities at the merchant fair," Pratchett continues. "So much for rest and relaxation, though, eh?"

Without warning, a heavy clay cup sails through the air and strikes Pratchett squarely in the face. The dwarf adventurer roars with laughter while his companions cheer. Pratchett staggers back, clutching his bleeding nose, crimson droplets staining his immaculate cravat.

"I expect this disturbance to be handled with appropriate force—nothing more, nothing less," Lieutenant Lavarsus's stern instructions echo in your mind as you survey the chaos before you. The serious, no-nonsense lieutenant would expect nothing short of professionalism in restoring order to the Tipsy Tengu.

Pratchett steps aside, revealing Belberry's face—a portrait of desperation and hope as she looks to your group for salvation. The scent of spilled ale mingles with the aroma of what must have been a delicious roast before it ended up decorating the wall. Another chair crashes to the floor as the leather-clad halfling adventurer attempts to demonstrate what appears to be a dance move atop a table.

Your first real assignment as Magnimar's newest guardians has arrived, and it's clear that maintaining the peace in the City of Monuments will be anything but monotonous

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-01 18:06:53):
What happens next?
:)

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-05-01 19:58:53):
In order to disguise her amusement after Pratchett gets hit by the mug, Nadya fidgets with her alchemy gear. After a moment she'll pass an elixir to Pratchett with a reassuring smile.

"For the pain, if you want it."

Turning to the source of the trouble, Nadya begins to fetch more components from her supplies. She whispers words to the other agents, masked by sorcery so as not to be overheard.

"I can try talking this out first, unless someone else wants to try."

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-05-01 22:15:49):
"I will loom menacingly in the background, a pointed reminder that these 'adventurers' do not want to tangle with us. But I will leave the talking to you."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-05-03 17:04:08):
"Yeah, you did strike me as an accomplished 'loom menacingly-er.' Think well of me in your heart, for luck." 

Nadya winks, drains a silvertongue mutagen, and steps toward the ongoing disturbance. She waves a hand and causes a loud clap to sound directly in front of her with a figment spell. With conspicuous theatric flair, Nadya will project her voice as though speaking to a large audience.

"How friends, eyes and ears here now. Hearken well, or my dear looming friend behind me may find cause to approach you rapidly and will ill intent. Your revelry has grown out of control, and you have terrified the poor proprietress and her staff. You, Caydenite, should be ashamed in particular. All of you, step with me into the street and allow the Tipsy Tengu a moment of respite and peace."

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-05-03 17:10:53):
Lysandra stands behind Nadya, using her imposing bulk to glower down at the rabble-rousers. Her hands stay away from the blades sheathed where her human and horse torsos meet, but it's obvious she's uncomfortable not having them drawn.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-03 18:00:54):
Each adventurer's story emerges through snippets of conversation, slurred confessions, and the observations of less inebriated patrons.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-03 18:01:25):
Bolar of Stonemoor, the dwarf whose horned helmet sits askew on his tangled mane, paces the floor with a dangerous energy. 

His pupils are unnaturally dilated, his movements too quick and jerky.

 When confronted, he pounds his chest and roars about "proving what a real warrior can do." 

A nearby patron whispers to you Nadya that the barbarian returned from their expedition without a single kill to his name—a shameful outcome he's attempting to remedy with both alchemical stimulants and the promise of tavern brawl glory.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-03 18:02:52):
In a corner booth, Miriel Grayleaf slumps over her seventh emptied wine glass. 

The elven wizard's robes bear not just drink stains but tear tracks as well. 

Between incomprehensible mutterings, she repeatedly conjures and dismisses a tiny illusion of a black bird. 

"Runkles wouldn't want this," she slurs to no one in particular, before contradicting herself: 
"But Runkles isn't here anymore, is he?" 

A serving girl explains to you, Nadya, that the wizard's raven familiar perished during their dungeon delve, and she hasn't been sober since their return.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-03 18:03:24):
The halfling, Skebs, presents a different problem altogether. 

His leather armor is festooned with pilfered silverware, napkins, and even a patron's monocle. 

He dances across tabletops with surprising agility for someone so intoxicated, tossing stolen coins into the air and catching them with practised fingers. 

An indignant merchant points him out to Nadya, describing how the rogue's clumsy attempt to pick his pocket moments ago resulted in the halfling dumping an entire purse of copper pieces across the floor before declaring it "raining money in Magnimar tonight!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-03 18:04:56):
Meanwhile, Antaro Boldblade stands atop the bar itself, tankard raised high as he leads a discordant chorus of drinking songs. 

The human cleric's armor gleams with the polished mug symbol of Cayden Cailean, god of ale and freedom. 

Unlike his companions, Antaro needs no specific reason for his revelry—his exuberant worship of the Drunken Hero involves celebrating life through liberal consumption of spirits. 

"It's Toilday!" he proclaims when you, Nadya, come near him, as though this calendar fact alone constitutes sufficient justification for upending the tavern's peace.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-03 18:05:58):
Together, these four adventurers have transformed what should have been an evening of tasteful entertainment into a maelstrom of broken furniture, spilt drinks, and frayed nerves. 

Agent Nadya, as you finish surveying the scene, you realise that each troublemaker will require a separate attempt at diplomacy or intimidation to restore order to the Tipsy Tengu.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-03 18:07:08):
Lysandra needs to roll first.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-03 18:07:13):
For the aid to Nadya.

@ArtyArtillery 

Feel free to roll :)

*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-03 19:09:19):
So those are all successes.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-05-03 19:09:45):
Nadya talk good.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-03 19:12:15):
The 4 adventurers calm down and surrender.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-03 19:12:19):
Your badges all GLOW!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-03 19:12:28):
You can now fine them for their public disturbance.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-03 19:12:37):
Do you activate the magic of the badges?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-03 19:13:21):
This will fine the four adventurers.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-05-03 19:21:27):
Nadya will turn to the other agents.

"Whaddya think? Any lessons learned?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-05 15:04:12):
Roster / player list.

@ArtyArtillery 
Nadya.

@Revan1734 
Lysandea Dawnstride.

@HistoricallyInaccurate 
Zilde EvenGuard.

@Nemesiux 
Eclipsar.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-05 15:06:20):
@Nemesiux 

Do you walk into the tipsy tengu?

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-05-05 15:11:20):
Eclipsar, as he enters the inn, he claps and says, "Well done,  Lieutenant Lavarsus would be pleased to see that you have done an excellent work"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-05-05 15:12:26):
Eclipsar briefly bow before the group and speaks slowly, "I am Eclipsar, a pleasure to meet you. I am to assist you in your activities"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-05-05 15:14:36):
*[image]*

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-05-05 15:25:48):
Appearance wise Eclipsar looks like a Nidalese mercenary warrior. Their warriors are renowned for their cruel combat style which is designed to cause as much pain as possible

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-05-05 17:21:58):
Nadya casually looks over towards the door and waves playfully.

"Oh~! I didn't realize we could swap our uniforms for Kuthite ones, maybe I would have dressed differently. Welcome in, we were just deciding on fining these fine folks here. They did give up peacefully after all."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-05-05 18:06:42):
Eclipsar gives you a serious look"My faith requires me to worship and show loyalty to the  Lord of Pain in every moment of our existence including the way we dress. 
The contract that I signed with the lieutenant specifically stated that I am allowed to practice my faith as long as I don't force it on others and in return I ensure the city safety. "
Eclipsar looks at the adventurers while holding his sword." These ... people must be punished according to the law of the land."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-05-05 18:08:25):
"I assume your name is Nadya. Why are you stalling their punishment?"

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-05-05 18:34:03):
"For fun. I would have thought you would be all for drawing things out..."

She shrugs and activates the badge. Nadya will mutter to to the adventurers as she does.

"Right then, get outta here. Be good now."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-05-05 18:36:02):
"So, you assume my name? And you're right, too. Can't say I appreciate having a reputation already, it's been less than a week since my cover was blown and now everyone knows me."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-05-05 18:40:42):
"This moment is about enforcing the law of the city
It has nothing to do with my faith.... yet and this is our job not something for you to have "fun"
I was briefed on who shall be my new colleagues"
Every reply from Eclipsar seems sharp and to the point

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-05-05 20:20:50):
"Sure, this is a job. Everything is to uphold the rightful order, but I can take a moment to enjoy a job well done every once in a while. Besides this isn't nearly as fun as my old job, I'm taking what I can get at this point."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-06 11:43:05):
The badges glow, the symbol of Magnimar is projected into the air.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-06 11:43:35):
A powerful magic invokes the fundamental magics of LAWFUL axiomatic energy.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-06 11:44:22):
The power of the axis, hell and the city's monuments themselves come together, gathering the context of what the badge has witnessed.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-06 11:44:51):
An injection of information is given to everyone in the room:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-06 11:45:31):
17 GOLD PIECES HAVE BEEN EXTRACTED FROM THESE ADVENTURER'S ABADAR BACKED ADVENTURING ACCOUNT.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-06 11:45:36):
AND

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-06 11:48:45):
EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN CONFISCATED.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-06 11:49:05):
The badges have access to a shared very very large capacity magical storage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-06 11:49:32):
A bag of holding that functions like an ender chest (Minecraft).

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-06 11:49:47):
Inside you will find these adventures confiscated equipment.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-06 12:47:29):
I will put a more full list later, but for now:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-06 12:47:41):
- cross bow & 10 bolts.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-06 12:47:44):
- dagger

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-06 12:47:58):
- battle axe, studded leather armor

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-06 12:48:11):
- rapier, wooden shield, splint mail

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-06 12:48:31):
- 4 daggers, studded leather armor

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-06 12:48:44):
And that's all.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-05-07 01:39:39):
"Well, that's all dealt with then. They didn't injure anyone before we got here, did they?"
Nadya will call out so the proprietress can hear from back near the bar.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-07 09:05:41):
The adventuring group pays their drink tab after grumbling that they will need to get new gear tomorrow at a low end discount adventuring store.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-07 09:14:02):
The adventuring group leaves.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-07 09:14:04):
Belberry Breckenridge, now far more relaxed, steps up on the ledge behind the bar allowing her to see over it more properly and says:

"By Abadar's golden vault, I can't thank you enough, Agent Nadya! What a blessing the Magi Watch has been to our little corner of Lowcleft today! When I invested my life savings into the Tipsy Tengu, I dreamed of a place where dignitaries could enjoy fine conversation by day and locals could share tales by night. Adventurers spinning yarns of heroism, not... whatever this shameful display was.

"I should have known better than to let them drink here, the so-called 'Splendid Spelunkers' the way they were acting before drinking! 

My cousin Tilly warned me about dungeon-delvers who can't hold their liquor. 
'They face death daily,' she said, 'so they live as though each cup might be their last.' 
Seems she was right, though that cleric of Cayden took the philosophy rather too literally, wouldn't you say?

"Please, consider the Tipsy Tengu your sanctuary whenever you're patrolling this district. The Magi Watch will always find a clean mug and a fresh pour waiting, absolutely free of charge, whenever you're on duty or off. 
And do try our spiced mutton stew when you return; my chef Gorble trained in the kitchens of the Summit and brings those refined techniques to our more modest establishment.

"Oh! 
And I'll be sure to post the official Magi Watch seal by our door—might dissuade the next band of rowdy adventurers from thinking they can turn my tavern into their personal battlefield. Now, can I pour you something before you head back to your patrol? Something to fortify you against the evening chill? If not right now, well, the offer stands whenever you wish to claim it. Magnimar is fortunate indeed to have guardians like yourself keeping the peace!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-07 09:15:28):
Belberry Breckenridge is offering the group to stay for drinks but as it is the middle of the day, the group knows they are needed back at the Avensoar to report in.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-05-07 12:18:01):
Lysandra gives a respectful nod. “Thank you for the offer ma’am, but we have a report to make.” She carefully makes her way through the Tipsy Tengu, avoiding any further disturbance as she exits. Once she’s back in the open, she takes a deep breath and looks over her shoulder for the others.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-07 14:17:48):
The winding stone staircase of the Arvensoar leads you to Lieutenant Lazarus's office on the mid-levels of the towering structure. The afternoon sun streams through narrow windows, casting long shadows across the worn stone floor. The ever-present sounds of Magnimar—merchants hawking wares and ships' horns from the harbor below—are muffled at this height, replaced by the occasional clink of armor and murmur of guards going about their duties.

As you approach the weathered oak door bearing Lieutenant Lazarus's name on a brass plaque, you notice it's already ajar. Inside, Lieutenant Lazarus is standing behind his desk, which is cluttered with reports, maps of Magnimar's districts, and a half-empty mug of cooling tea. But he's not alone.

Captain Acacia Uriana stands by the window, her back straight as a sword blade, fiery red hair pulled back in a severe bun that does nothing to diminish her commanding presence. Her uniform is immaculate, the polished insignia of Magnimar's city watch catching the light. When she turns to face you, her sharp eyes assess each of you with military precision.

"Ah, there they are," Lazarus says, gesturing you inside. "The ones I was telling you about, Captain."

Uriana's expression remains stern, but there's a flicker of interest in her gaze. "So these are our new specialists. I hear you just resolved a situation with a disruptive tengu in the Market District without a single casualty or property damage claim. Impressive, considering the reports say they were armed and quite inebriated."

Lieutenant Lazarus shuffles some papers on his desk. "The Magni Watch experiment is proving successful so far, Captain. A specialized unit focusing on urban crimes rather than external threats gives our regular patrols more bandwidth."

"That remains to be seen," Captain Uriana replies, though her tone lacks its usual edge. She circles the room, studying each of you more carefully. "Commander Odinburge is watching this experiment closely. There are many in the Arvensoar who think our resources are better spent on traditional approaches. Prove them wrong."

She nods curtly to Lazarus. "I'll expect those reports by sundown, Lieutenant," she says before turning back to you. "As for you... I'll be watching your group's progress with great interest."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-07 14:17:55):
Captain Acacia Uriana leaves.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-07 14:19:42):
Lieutenant Lavarsus:
"Well well.

You heard her, you did well.

Don't let it get to your head.

Now head on home, your day is done.

See you all early tomorrow!"

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-05-07 15:12:18):
Lysandra snaps a smart salute. “Yes sir. Tomorrow morning.” She eagerly leaves the tall building, gingerly working her way down the staircase not built to accommodate someone of her size.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-05-07 18:13:22):
"Early tomorrow, aye."

By the time Nadya gets to the office's exit, her uniform jacket is already over her shoulder. She follows down the stairs with more energy than she had during any of the day's events.

"Hey, how's about it, all? I've got flay and booze that'll go bad by morning, and no home is closer than the nearest dive. If we're to work together, we should relax together every once in a while."

**Eimer Hone** (2025-05-07 18:20:33):
“Thank you sir. Do we know what’s next for us?” Zilde questions

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-05-07 18:58:17):
Eclipsar simply does a military salute and then leaves

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-07 19:51:06):
What next? :)

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-05-07 19:54:55):
Eclipsar simply smiles "I signed a contract with you lieutenant. Fear not, it is not Magnimar that they seek,but rather who works for you at the moment. Farewell and I shall see you tomorrow."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-07 20:18:38):
Is everyone going to the bar?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-13 01:44:15):
You go to the Tipsy Tengus, you get free drinks and lodging.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-13 01:44:24):
Unless the party is interested in anything else, do the party go to sleep?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-13 02:20:04):
If so I assume you all sleep at the Tipsy Tengu, have breakfast and go to work?

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-05-13 02:53:58):
Nadya drinks and smokes a bunch because she had leftover stuff from daily prep, but otherwise that sounds good lol

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-15 20:06:37):
So the next day...

**Eimer Hone** (2025-05-15 22:35:55):
Zilde makes her way to the Lieutenant for more orders.

**Eimer Hone** (2025-05-17 16:39:47):
Zilde meets the group at the office

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-17 22:09:42):
Sergeant Moldun Ollo is a dwarf senior officer. 

He is not just senior in rank, he is OLD.

Sergeant Moldun Ollo, in his full armour adorned with the symbology of the Arvensoar and the city of Magnimar.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-17 22:10:28):
Sergeant Moldun Ollo has greeted the group and made sure you are all in a healthy state, in uniform and that you all have your badges.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-17 22:11:24):
Sergeant Moldun Ollo is explaining your patrol route for the day and he....he stops talking, his eyes close.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-17 22:11:33):
Sergeant Moldun Ollo lets out a snore.

Sergeant Moldun Ollo has fallen asleep, mid sentence.

**Eimer Hone** (2025-05-18 10:05:58):
“Am… sergeant? Hello?” Zilde speaks to try wake him up

**Eimer Hone** (2025-05-18 20:54:50):
Zilde shakes the sergeant hoping it will wake him

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-05-18 21:00:24):
"If this is the state of management at the headquarters, it's a wonder my cover wasn't blown earlier."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-20 12:19:59):
Sergeant Moldun Ollo shakes his head and groans:
"Apologies officers.
I... I'm an old dwarf now.

I've seen this city, from its founding to now, in such a time I've seen 300 years of trouble and terrors, squashed by the guard."

Sergeant Moldun Ollo's eyes drift out of a window, towards the Irespan mega bridge and the Steaming Sea that lays beyond it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-20 12:24:10):
Sergeant Moldun Ollo says softly:
"After the murder cult, Ironbriar whom I thought I knew well, the problems in Sandpoint, the cypher mages setting up a base, the alchemical academy's head master being a demon lord worshipper, the succubus incident, wererats, the shadow clock, the goblin guild, the tunnels, the ghouls and the..."

Sergeant Moldun Ollo stops himself suddenly as if he was about to say something that was not for you all to hear.

Sergeant Moldun Ollo clears his throat:
".... It's been a lot, all in the last 3 years!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-20 12:24:58):
Sergeant Moldun Ollo continue:
"Well well.
I suppose that's why we need new guards, new Magi Watchers as you've been called, to ensure that the city is safe, its people are safe."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-20 12:25:31):
Sergeant Moldun Ollo:
"Good job in the tavern yesterday but you have a lot farther to go.
Here is a map of the city and I've marked your patrol route on the map."

**Eimer Hone** (2025-05-20 12:57:46):
“Zilde takes the map. Thanks Sergeant.”

**Eimer Hone** (2025-05-20 18:57:07):
Yes

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-25 00:04:33):
You go for on patrol...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-25 00:10:17):
As you go on Patrol you are alerted to a problem at the dockway which you go to investigate.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-05-25 00:11:08):
Lysandra will lead the way

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-25 00:11:29):
Awesome.

THE DOCKWAY FOOD FIGHT - MAGNIMAR

The acrid stench of burning grease and goblin profanity cuts through the salt-tinged air of Lower Dockway, where a cluster of ramshackle food stalls clings to the weathered stones overlooking the Yondabakari River's mouth. 

What started as another day of questionable culinary commerce has devolved into a goddamn war zone.

Two particularly dilapidated establishments face each other like prizefighters in a ring of smoke and chaos. 

Everything Fried - a precarious stack of oil-stained planks held together by rust-eaten nails and sheer goblin stubbornness - squares off against Pelmo's Pickle Emporium, an equally pathetic collection of scorched boards that looks like it survived a dragon's breakfast and came back for seconds.

The air reeks of alchemical fire as a clay jar filled with blazing cooking oil arcs through the smoke, shattering against Pelmo's stall in a burst of orange flame that sends neighboring vendors scrambling like rats from a sinking ship. 

Clockwork ventilation fans, their gears grinding and sparking, struggle futilely to clear the billowing smoke while enchanted preservation runes flicker and fail on nearby meat hooks.

Grunka - a scar-faced goblin bitch with arms like twisted steel cables and a vocabulary that would make a Riddleport pirate blush - hurls another firebomb while screaming creative threats involving anatomically impossible acts with pickle barrels. 

Across the makeshift battlefield, Pelmo - missing half an ear and sporting burn marks that suggest this isn't his first culinary duel - loads his mechanical pickle-launcher with jars of his own alchemically-enhanced brine bombs.

"I'll fry your fucking pickles and feed them to sewer rats!" Grunka roars, her oversized deep fryers - massive clockwork contraptions that bubble and hiss with superheated oil - working overtime despite the growing flames licking at their brass fittings.

"Your greasy shit-food wouldn't feed a starving kobold!" Pelmo screams back, cranking the tension springs on his pickle artillery with manic glee.

The territorial pissing match has escalated beyond mere commerce into a literal firefight that threatens to consume half the Dockway.

Neighboring vendors - hawking everything from questionable seafood to imported Chelish wine - duck behind their stalls as flaming projectiles whiz overhead. 

The mechanical fire-suppression golems installed by the city watch spark and malfunction, their water reserves turning the spreading oil into a skating rink of potential doom.

Most concerning are the dozen barrels of alchemically-enhanced cooking oil stacked behind Everything Fried - each one marked with warning runes that pulse ominously red in the firelight. 

The clockwork pressure gauges on several barrels are already deep in the danger zone, their needle trembling like a guilty man's hands.

The other vendors are pointing frantically at the barrels while backing away, shouting warnings about imminent explosions that could level half the block. 

But the two goblin chefs are too caught up in their culinary blood feud to give a shit about collateral damage - they're having the time of their miserable lives.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-25 00:13:28):
Time for the Magni watch to earn their pay...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-25 00:13:49):
How you approach this is down to yous.

“Help me move those barrels now!” Lysandra shouts to any burly-looking onlookers as she rushes in to try and avoid letting this turn in to an ever bigger catastrophe, leaving the miscreants to someone else for now.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-05-25 16:03:43):
As she calls out, Lysandra will stride to the barrels, pick one up (two if possible - I'm not sure how big they are), and carry it away, somewhere less hazardous.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-05-25 21:15:45):
Nadya will run forward and cast command (prone) on the closest of the two fighting goblins.

"Cease this fight immediately!"
