**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-02 12:54:32):
What next? :)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-02 19:03:48):
(waiting for @Linksanelf2006 to report back)

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-09-03 02:32:31):
"Ummm..." Akuma tries hard to think about exactly what he saw, "I think it helps him hide lovers in a carriage somewhere outside." 
He shrugs at his relative disappointment.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-03 08:53:13):
What next? :)

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-09-03 08:57:48):
“I agree. We should check out the carriage once we have dealt with the beast.” Lysandra will lead the way back out of the office to look for the ankhrav.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-04 23:49:19):
...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-04 23:50:43):
You go outside and see two wagons.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-04 23:51:00):
The first wagon is Mr Knight's wagon.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-04 23:51:06):
Akuma was in Mr Knight's wagon just now.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-04 23:51:43):
The 2nd wagon says "VET"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-04 23:52:03):
It is clearly the wagon of Minera Frum.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-04 23:52:10):
Does anyone in the group have Magnimar lore?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-04 23:52:43):
Akuma has already searched Mr Knight's wagon, finding nothing of note.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-04 23:52:52):
The party explore Minera Frum's wagon.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-04 23:53:22):
It's clear that Minera has two loves:  animals and Archibald Knight.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-04 23:54:46):
You find Minera Frum's diary, it describes her relationship for Mr Knight.

A workplace romance turned steamy passion.

The back half of the diary describes their sexual encounters in graphic detail.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-04 23:55:10):
In the wagon you also find a few more items...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-04 23:56:53):
The various cupboards are filled with items useful in the care and treatment of creatures, both magical and mundane. 

These include: 

- 6 x minor healing potions.
- A wand of command.
- A dose of anti paralysis salve.
- A vial of lesser antidote. 
- A vial of lesser anti-plague.
- A scroll of charm.
- A scroll of speak with animals.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-04 23:57:03):
Your Magni Watch badges glow.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-04 23:57:11):
The items all glow and are absorbed.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:06:56):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:07:57):
Minera Frum's books can also be taken and read by someone in the group.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:08:20):
This will make identifying the strengths and weaknesses of animals permeantly easier!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:08:27):
Who would like this?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:08:54):
Anyways, continuing on you find yourselves walking through the Rust monster exhibit.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:09:56):
The fall is splattered with dried blood.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:10:21):
The enclosure is fully made of wood, the perfect prison for such a creature.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:10:35):
A sign says his name is Rusty the Rust Monster.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:11:00):
You keep going.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:11:46):
You walk through the crystal ankhrav enclosure.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:12:47):
This room is made to look underground, like a cave.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:12:58):
Corpses litter the floor everywhere.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:13:51):
You hear weeping behind a boulder on the far end of the enclosure.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:14:02):
A sound is heard by the group.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:14:05):
The ground shakes.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:14:08):
Cracks form.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:14:14):
and BURSTING from the ground...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 00:14:56):

Also, it does not use a reaction.

(Need to do rolls)

As you defeat the bastard.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-06 10:49:23):
A 7 year old, crying boy.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-06 10:49:27):
Comes running out.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-06 10:49:30):
Towards the group

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-06 10:49:41):
He runs into the arms of Zilde EvenGuard @HistoricallyInaccurate

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-06 10:49:52):
The boys:
"DADDDDDDDDDY WHERE'S DADDDDDDY"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-06 10:50:03):
Besides a few scrapes, the boy is unharmed.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-06 10:50:16):
You find out the boy's name is Jerov.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-06 10:50:31):
And his father Nils you met in the snake room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-06 10:52:01):
You return the boy to his father, Nils.

Nils gives the party a pouch of 17 gold pieces as a reward, insisting that the group take the money.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-06 10:52:36):
*[image]* The Magni Watch badge makes the money disappear.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-06 10:52:43):
Bring stash funds to 108 Gold Pieces.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-06 10:53:17):
The zoo keepers tell you that the last place to check out the supply shed, but there shouldn't be any more animals.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-06 10:53:27):
And sure enough, in the supply shed there is only 1 being.

**Eimer Hone** (2025-09-06 10:53:44):
“Let’s get this finished.” Zilde rolls her eyes getting impatient

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-06 10:53:47):
*[image]* You find Remy, a gnomish zoo keeper.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-09-06 15:59:21):
"Why are you hiding in here?" Akuma asks the employee.

**Eimer Hone** (2025-09-06 21:37:40):
“Do you need help?” Zilde asks

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-07 15:06:40):
Remy:
"Oh gosh, hello friends! I'm Remy."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-07 15:07:17):
Remy: 
"I'm the head zoo keeper."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-07 15:07:40):
Remy explains he was getting supplies when the monsters broke lose.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-07 15:07:57):
Besides a few scrapes and bruises, Remy is mostly ok.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-07 15:08:29):
Remy is more upset that Rusty the Rust Monster would attack him.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-07 15:08:54):
Remy shows the Magni Watch his Rusty tattoo, Rusty loved Remy and Remy loved Rusty.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-07 15:10:18):
Yet still: Rusty attacked Remy, if Rusty's attack had landed, Remy would have lost his arm.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-07 15:10:42):
Remy also gives the group a reward of 2 heavy crossbows with 10 bolts each.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-07 15:11:34):
And with that... the Magnimar zoo and the lives of many patrons and zoo staff have been saved!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-07 15:14:04):
So 2 things.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-07 15:18:08):
1. You have downtime for the rest of the day.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-07 15:21:43):
"Since when are rabbits so aggressive they jump and bite into your neck?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-07 15:26:23):
2. We have completed 5% of Magni Watch! :D

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-07 15:26:51):
Please decide what you do on your day off (downtime).

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-07 17:55:43):
What next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-07 18:36:10):
So what next? :)

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-09-07 22:52:48):
After fighting a whole zoo she just wants to relax

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-07 23:39:23):
Machiq will head to the guards and sue Remy for damages on account of negligence.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-07 23:40:23):
Awesome ideas :)

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-09-08 01:10:03):
Lysandra will join in with the training

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-09-08 18:55:12):
Akuma will spend the day practicing his stances and working primarily on his grip, which was such a problem the day before.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-08 19:36:10):
*[(File not included. Change data exporting settings to download.)]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-08 19:36:28):
Does the group do anything socially together?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-08 19:36:33):
Perhaps dinner? Drinks? Etc?

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-09-08 19:39:59):
((Akuma will join in drinks and dinner if offered, otherwise he tries to remain respectful by not automatically including himself. 
Also, I would suppose the practice could count as "Exercise"))

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-09 11:51:29):
So who would like their night + day off handled first?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-09 11:51:47):
Also, we will be having a day off every time we complete 5% of the campaign, at minimum.

**Eimer Hone** (2025-09-09 19:02:41):
Zilde will also join in with training. Then she will go visit her father and tell him about the adventures the group has been on so far

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-12 15:39:09):
OK, I will go one at a time.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-14 16:32:10):
@ArtyArtillery 

Do you have Magnimar lore?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-14 16:33:16):
@Askarans 

You head to the Arvensoar.

After talking to some guards, you are directed to an office.

Within the office is a dwarf looking through a filing cabinet, he is....wait, he's asleep standing up in full armour!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-14 16:33:33):
Gijō, Lysandra and Zilde you train together.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-14 16:34:15):
Zilde, you walk from the Arvensoar to your house.

It is close by.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-14 16:35:55):
You arrive at your cosy stone house.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-14 16:36:59):
Zilde, you make your way through the hallway, removing your armoured sabatons.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-14 16:37:29):
Your father sits at the kitchen table, the room is dark in the evening light, a single ever burning candle lighting the room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-14 16:37:47):
James Darkmoon is reading a letter that was sealed with the sigil of Cheliax.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-14 16:54:33):
The old old old dwarf looks at you.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-14 16:54:55):
Sergeant Moldun Ollo:
"Sergeant Moldun Ollo, and you are....?"

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-09-16 01:39:43):
That's what she's used to

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-16 01:44:26):
You will be stabbed, eaten or lost forever...

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-09-16 01:46:47):
I figure Nadya has been around in Magnimar long enough to have enough close calls to know not to venture toooooo far alone. From before she was a guard, she must have had a few hangouts that were (relatively) safe enough

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-16 01:50:00):
The only thing else in this room is another door just next to the desk.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-16 01:50:43):
The hairy fetchling is scratching his neck and his blood shot eyes dart at you, immediately he draws a dagger:
"What brings a guard to my den?"

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-09-16 01:57:25):
"Eh?"

Nadya looks down at her uniform.

"Oh, right."

She shapechanges to her pale redheaded human 'tailless form' and begins to unbutton the jacket.

"Sorry. It's been a rough few months. They've got me actually wearing the damn thing, in daylight no less."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-16 02:54:16):
The hairy fetchling indicates you can follow him through the door.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-16 06:21:29):
The hairy fetchling pulls a lever, a series of gears and runes lowers the lift down several floors.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-16 06:23:16):
The hairy fetchling, introducing himself as Shackle flips the switch, the lift stops in front of a door.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-16 06:23:41):
Shackle opens the door, several figures are sitting on cushions in this long thin stone room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-16 06:24:05):
A couple of small smokeless braziers keep the room warm.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-16 06:24:21):
Shackle gets you a clean cushioned space.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-16 06:25:59):
Shackle:
"Smoke, eat, inject?"

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-09-16 06:29:05):
"It's gonna be smoke today. I had to fight an entire zoo of crap. City's not supposed to have ankhrav in it but some rich fuck has to ruin things with his weird pets."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-09-16 06:34:41):
"Just because they're making me walk around upstairs doesn't change the deal, Shackle."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-09-16 06:35:51):
"If the guard shows up down here, it won't be because of me. You're performing a necessary task for society to function as far as I see it."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-16 06:37:05):
Shackle hands you a dark black genie's lamp.

Faint wisps of white smoke escape from the lamp's tip.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-09-16 06:44:44):
Nadya is gonna settle down comfortably and examine the lamp.

"What have we here, exactly? This keleshite or something?"

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-09-16 07:33:37):
Amused by the presentation, Nadya takes a hit.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-18 20:18:08):
"Uh..." 
Machiq is perplexed about that.. "One way to get a job.." he sighs in exasperation.
Disappointed, and frustrated about the outcome he hoped for being smashed down like this, he leaves the office, slamming the door.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-19 07:45:24):
Shackles:
"You have a letter. 
They knew you were here."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-19 07:45:35):
Shackles stress itches.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-19 07:45:46):
Shackles:
"How could they know?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-19 07:45:57):
Shackles also says:
"And... How was the experience?"

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-09-19 07:51:06):
"Huh. Great is Asmodeus, I guess. Its funny, actually. Normally its speak of devil and he shall appear. This time I only just thought about 'em."

Nadya takes the envelope and tucks it into a shirt pocket.

"Because, that... whatever it was, made me feel like a duke of Hell. Like I was Bifrons or something. Maybe its just because violence is on my mind recently, maybe its just how that stuff is. Maybe its just because of the special relationship I have with blood, i dunno. I thought it was alright, but other folks might be scared off by that kind of stuff."

"As for how they found me... I mean, if this seal is legitimate, I wouldn't want to know if I was you. Probably dangerous to know too much. Probably shouldn't ask too many questions about it."

Nadya leans forward with a smile.

"Good. Till next time, then."

She heads out and makes her way down the street to find an empty spot of town with fewer eyes before pulling out the letter and cracking the seal.

Nadya sighs with relief - a mandatory party is one of the less dangerous things to come in a letter with a seal like that. She tucks the letter back into her bag and begins to head off towards the Tipsy Tengu.

“Indeed. Some interesting fights. The team becoming more resilient guards by each fight.”
