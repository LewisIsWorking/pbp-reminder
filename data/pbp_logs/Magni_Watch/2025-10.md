**Eimer Hone** (2025-10-03 16:03:21):
"I'm sure we are father. I'll come too" Zilde sighs from disappointment

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-04 01:02:46):
James Darkmoon quickly says:
"No no no.
You stay here.
Uh, rest and prepare yourself."

James Darkmoon stands up, putting the letter into his spacious pouch, strides across the room with great speed and before you get much of a chance to think, he is out of the room, out of the house.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-04 01:03:24):
@HistoricallyInaccurate 

Zilde, your father did not seem to want for you to come with him / spend time with him.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-04 01:04:55):
@ArtyArtillery 

Nadya, as you walk through the dockway, appearing from just out of your eye line is a well known guard captain: James Darkmoon.

You may have seen him before but he is own to keeping to himself and being VERY dedicated to his work.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-04 01:06:30):
James Darkmoon's dark hair and pale white skin, broad shoulders and piercing gaze is unsettling and intense...yet...there's something a bit familiar about it.

Perhaps you've met one of his relatives.

James Darkmoon:
"You are Nadya. 
Correct?
You'll have received your letter by now.
Come with me."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-10-04 01:10:01):
"Captain!" Nadya exclaims with some surprise at being approached. "I'm needed now?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-04 01:21:50):
James Darkmoon immediately walks off, goes to the Arvensoar and gets the others.

James Darkmoon walks to his house with the rest of the party.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-04 01:22:12):
@ArtyArtillery 

Do you do anything?

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-10-04 01:35:24):
Nadya despondently nods as a greeting. "Hey."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-10-04 01:54:19):
"I'm gonna go try and wash my uniform. It's still gross and sweaty from, uh, the whole zoo thing. Captain should be around soon with the rest of us."

**Eimer Hone** (2025-10-04 18:38:39):
Zilde gives a half hearted smile. “Hi. Yes do want you need to do.” 

Zilde goes back into a state of confusion from the sudden behaviour from her father.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-09 01:36:39):
James Darkmoon arrives at the Arvensoar, gathers the rest of the group and everyone is reunited at Zilde's house.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-09 02:13:41):
James Darkmoon:
"As you have all received your letter, there is a garden party on tonight.

Your group are acting as.... extra security.

The reason behind this is...."

James Darkmoon seems to think for a moment and say:
"A somewhat political power play.

Just to be clear: 
- there won't be any issues tonight.
- any issues would be greatly outside your capabilities.
- and...."

James Darkmoon sighs:

"....and you'll all need to wear guard suitwear and dressware.

I have Magni-Watch versions of both in the armoury downstairs.

Feel free to pick whatever one suits you best, there are a couple slightly different colour and appearance variations.

And whenever your all ready I shall escort us to the Alabaster district."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-09 02:14:41):
As James Darkmoon speaks, his quiet voice lands upon the ears as loud and clearly heard.

James Darkmoon oozes an authority that is impossible to resist.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-10-09 17:00:34):
Akuma gives a salute to the Captain before heading downstairs. He does glance at the rest of the squad to see if they are just as puzzled as he is regarding their assignment and lack of details, but figures they would be able to talk about it later.

It takes a bit for him to find an outfit that fits his frame while at the same time not making him look like a part of the entertainment for the evening.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-10-10 05:56:44):
Down in the armory, Nadya is already in the process of fitting herself and will offer to help other folks getting into their new, fancy uniforms. She looks about as out of place as she possibly could wearing the ceremonial dress.

**Eimer Hone** (2025-10-12 16:32:52):
Before going downstairs to get armour, Zilde turns to her father, “What is it. What do you think we aren’t capable of?”

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-14 01:13:31):
James Dark-Moon:
"You need more training and more time."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 05:45:59):
James Dark-moon:
"Are you all ready to go to the event?"

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-10-16 06:04:36):
"I suppose I'm not going to get more ready."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-10-16 21:22:23):
Akuma turns about with his arms outspread, both looking to see if everything looks in place while also presenting to those around him. 
"I think it fits." He says, with a bit of hesitation in his voice. He has never worn anything worth even half as much as this outfit.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-18 23:17:32):
James Dark-Moon seems satisfied that you are all ready.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-18 23:17:46):
And a carriage takes the group up the seacleft cliff.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-18 23:17:48):
Across the city.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-18 23:17:55):
And to the Alabaster district.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-18 23:18:32):
The Magni Watch arrive at a large manor house, the house is black and red in colour.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-18 23:26:38):
It is regal yet daunting.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-18 23:26:49):
The sounds of music is heard.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-18 23:27:01):
Classical music, a string quartet.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-18 23:27:19):
LOTS of people are going back and forth through the garden path around the manor.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-18 23:27:28):
You follow James Dark-Moon.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 18:59:28):
There are hundreds of people here.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 18:59:36):
All wearing lavish dresses and crisp suits.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 19:00:23):
Long tables stretch across the garden.

Each table is covered in a blood-red silken tablecloth.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 19:01:15):
Atop each table is far more expensive food and wine than any of you could consume over several days.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 19:02:16):
James Dark Moon gives you patrol areas, gives you instructions on when to check in and general advice and information.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 19:03:40):
As the night starts to really begin and even more people arrive, you see a familiar face: Viole of the Heroes of Magnimar!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 19:05:57):
And alongside Viole are the other Heroes of Magnimar.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 19:06:06):
Does anyone approach the heroes?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 19:06:24):
If not, I'll be progressing the story now.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 19:07:11):
>> - @Nemesiux Eclipsar. 
>> - @HistoricallyInaccurate Zilde EvenGuard. Magus/Fighter.
>> - @Askarans Machiq 
>> - @ArtyArtillery Nadya Rudean. 
>> - @Linksanelf2006 Akuma.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 19:10:07):
You are all busy with guard duty so we can have the conversations (if any) retroactively.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 19:43:33):
Near your foot, just poking out of a bush is a rat.

The rat looks at you Akuma, the scurries into the bush.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 19:46:39):
Meanwhile...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 19:47:57):
For 2 hours, the heroes of Magnimar seem to be looking around the grounds, doing a variety of magical channeling and searching.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 19:48:05):
They receive a few strange looks.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 19:50:13):
For 3 hours after that, the hero you recognise as Allisee is brewing something called "Unity Tea".

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 19:50:20):
You are each passed a cup.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 19:53:52):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:39:16):
Paracountess Zarta Dralneen:
"Welcome, welcome to my estate.

I am Paracountess Zarta Dralneen."

Paracountess Zarta Dralneen then courtesies.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:39:41):
Paracountess Zarta Dralneen insists you all try the unity tea and James Dark-Moon cautiously agrees.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:40:09):
James Dark-Moon:
"The Paracountress and I have some items of business to discuss, continue your guard."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:42:39):
James Dark-Moon goes off with the Paracountess.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:43:25):
As you all enjoy your tea and continue your guard, nothing much happens...for a bit.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:44:57):
@ArtyArtillery 

Nadya

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:45:36):
Nadya, you see Allisee and man walk off.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:45:47):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:47:42):
The man is covered in thick padded leather.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:47:52):
...and nothing happens for about 20 minutes.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:48:09):
Time stop at 10th level is cast.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:48:28):
The Magni Watch do not realise it but events are happening beyond what they witness.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:49:15):
Time unfreezes.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:50:49):
The heroes of Magnimar stand, a little out of breath and visibly injured.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:51:17):
There are piles of ash and a couple of strange gemstones laying in the ash.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:53:20):
In this garden is a bronze orb thing.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:53:23):
It's a decoration.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:53:38):
You would never really pay much attention to it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:55:20):
It glows and everyone, *everyone* at the party becomes stunned.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:55:39):
Even the protector Magnimar Jyronn Immikar and the great mages of the Golemworks, they are all stunned.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:56:23):
@Linksanelf2006 

Akuma is frozen, but you feel no pain and suffer no adverse effects.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:57:23):
Around 1,000 people collapse.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:57:56):
Black and green veins spread across people's bodies; they twist and contort on the ground.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 20:58:05):
This includes the members of the Magni Watch.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 21:00:41):
@HistoricallyInaccurate 

Zilde Even-Guard.

Your eyes are closing, your life as you know it, fading.

You see a figure sprinting towards you, his black hair catches the light of the moon, he is screaming, but your hearing has already stopped working.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 21:01:18):
@HistoricallyInaccurate 

You can make our parts of his yelling:

"Won't", "Again", "Please."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 21:02:00):
@Askarans 

The poison hurts Machiq particularly; it is not clear why.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 21:03:11):
Changer is not moving; the stone of his body glows intensely as if trying to absorb the energies of this magic, but just being completely unable to do so.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 21:13:46):
@Linksanelf2006 

Akuma, like I said, you are not overly affected by whatever is happening. 

You see James Dark-Moon run up to Zilde Even-Guard, genuinely scared. 

He prays, channelling magic and something happens.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 21:17:20):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 21:41:37):
Viole comes over to James Dark-Moon, the two of them cast something on the Magni Watch.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 21:41:58):
The party pass out, but none of you are dead.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-19 21:42:23):
- 45ish hours later -

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-20 06:22:12):
The group awakens.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-20 06:22:16):
You are all very sore.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-10-20 16:21:09):
Akuma finds himself lurching forward to aid however he can, but the moment fades as he loses consciousness. 

When he awakes, he feels his muscles screaming, as if he had just finished a hard day of training. He looks around to assess. Where is he? Where is everyone else? How many died while he was out? These are all thoughts that cross his mind.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-21 03:00:39):
You have awoken in a stone room; the ceiling is made of glass, and it is around dusk.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-21 03:00:53):
The room is relatively bright thanks to the ceiling.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-21 03:01:09):
A mechanical clock on the wall says the time is around 18:00.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-21 03:09:38):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-21 03:09:42):
You are all lying on beds.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-21 03:14:42):
You each have a green & black scar somewhere on your bodies.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-21 03:14:57):
You survived the soul poising but... just barely.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-21 03:18:33):
There is an elven woman in the room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-21 03:26:47):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-21 03:27:24):
@Linksanelf2006 

Your mark is in the vague shape of a rat. 

It does not hurt, unlike the marks of the others.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-21 03:35:06):
The elf is too buried in her notes and clipboard to notice you all stirring.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-21 03:36:09):
After a few seconds, she glances up.

Not to look at you all, but to note the time from the clock.

She looks down at her clipboard quickly.

Then looks up at you all, her eyes tell you that she is very surprised.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-21 03:39:16):
The elf says:

"Your....you're alive."

She starts making notes with a pen, writing quickly and without stopping, says:

"We didn't think you'd ever wake.

The others certainly didn't. 

Soul poisoning like that is very rare, way beyond our abilities to treat.

You're all very lucky to be alive.

The marks are persistent. The poison is halted. The marks won't go away until the curse has fully gone away.

Sister Miravelle has been praying to Sarenrae for just under 48 hours with barely any breaks."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-21 03:40:41):
The elf continues:

"Perhaps Miravelle's prayers came true.

Though I'd say it has probably as much to do with the attention Viole and Captain Dark-Moon has been giving you.

Sorry, that's General Viole Jule Grace, titles and all that...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-21 03:41:19):
The elf looks at you all now, up from her clipboard:

"I am Koriah Sunstrike.

Any questions?"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-10-21 03:44:48):
Machiq groans and holds his head as if he just had his worst hangover. He blinks, pinching his eyes, slowly adjusting to the light before he opens them. 
"Wha- what happened?"

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-10-21 04:44:39):
"1000... unconscious?" Akuma twists himself up into a sitting position. "Any deaths?"

He rubs the rat-like mark, curious of what it is. "A spell was cast. A powerful one. Does anyone have any leads on that?"

He has so many questions, but he tries to limit them to not pressure Koriah.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-10-21 05:57:52):
Nadya lies flat and tries to pull a pillow over her eyes with a groan. 

"Yeah. I am debatably alive. I suppose it's good to confirm I have a soul to be poisoned in the first place. Horrible, awful, headache-inducing method of finding out, however."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-10-21 06:19:53):
She sighs and rolls over, pressing her head into the bed.

"If Little Cheliax wants to invade, of course it would start at a garden party... Rich cultists, all of 'em. That spell, though, I can almost taste it still. Practically no one can use spellcraft that strong."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-10-21 22:59:13):
Machiq begins to sit up and look at himself, especially there were the wound still hurts.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:31:52):
The heavy wooden door at the end of the hall slams open with enough force to make Koriah flinch and nearly drop her clipboard.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:32:19):
Captain James Darkmoon strides in, his usually immaculate uniform dishevelled and wrinkled.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:32:30):
Dark circles shadow his eyes, and stubble marks his jaw.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:32:36):
Clear signs he hasn't slept in days.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:33:24):
This is not the composed captain you got dressed with at his house before the party. .

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:33:25):
This man looks like he's been through hell

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:33:34):
Behind him, a half-elven woman enters with a predator's grace, her wide-brimmed hat casting dramatic shadows across her tattooed features.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:33:40):
Unlike Darkmoon, she appears alert and focused, sharp eyes already cataloging every detail of the room with practiced efficiency.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:34:22):
His shoulders sag with visible relief, and for a moment, the captain (who is also Zilde's father) looks like he might actually break down.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:35:24):
James Darkmoon moves closer to the beds, his exhausted gaze sweeping over each of you.

He is visibly lingering on the green and black scars. 

His eyes find Zilde among you, and something raw and vulnerable crosses his face.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:35:47):
The half-elf leans against the doorframe, arms crossed, watching the reunion with clinical interest.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:35:54):
She pulls out a well-worn notebook, flipping it open with one hand while her other hand absently touches one of the visible tattoos on her forearm.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:36:01):
Half elf with wide hat:
"Captain's been here seventy-two hours straight," the woman drawls in a rough Docks accent.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:36:06):
Half elf with wide hat continues:
"Wouldn't leave. Had to threaten to arrest him for loitering just to get him to eat something."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:36:35):
Half elf with wide hat pushes off from the doorframe and saunters closer, her boots clicking against the stone floor.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:37:32):
Half-elf with a wide hat :
"Detective Desdelen Bolera. 
Arvensoar investigation department."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:37:38):
Detective Desdelen Bolera tips her hat slightly: 
"People call me Skinny. 
So call me Skinny.
I'm investigating what the fuck happened at that party."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:37:48):
James Darkmoon runs a hand through his unkempt hair.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:38:53):
James Dark-moon interrupts:
"One thousand people unconscious. 
Amar Rook-moon, The Harrower, vaporised. 
Selenor and Allisee are implicated in distributing the poison."

James is saying this vaguely, as if not really making a point.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:39:46):
Detective Desdelen "Skinny" Bolera circles closer to the beds, notebook ready, her demeanour shifting from casual to intensely professional.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:40:04):
Clearly, the detective is about to launch into questions.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-22 01:40:21):
James Dark-Moon shoots her a singular glance, and she physically takes a step back.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-10-23 18:21:19):
Akuma stands to test his balance. Once he feels comfortable with his footing, he walks over to the Captain and places his large hand gently on his shoulder. "You should rest, sir. It's time for a change in shifts." 

Regardless of what James does with that statement, Akuma will look over to the detective. "What do you need from us, Skinny?"

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-10-24 20:35:32):
"Sir." 

It is all Akuma can respond with. Captain Dark-Moon is the man in charge, and if he wants to stay awake even longer to speak with him, there is nothing that can be done.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-10-24 21:36:00):
Akuma, looking about the room, turns his right shoulder towards the captain. He yanks at the collar of his shirt to reveal the rat-like mark that sits in the supraclavicular fossa. 

"Is that some sort of seal?" He asks about the rubbery look of the room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-24 21:56:17):
Great pain rushes through your body.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-24 21:56:18):
BUT

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-24 21:56:23):
The green and black changes

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-24 21:57:03):
..towards fiery red and dark blue.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-10-24 22:10:03):
Akuma's muscles tense up in response to the pain. His teeth grind audibly as a few beads of sweat form. Once the change is finished, he rolls his shoulder a few times to ensure everything is still working correctly.

"Well..." he pauses. "What was that?"

Akuma looks back at his rat-like mark, its new color. He is reminded of Ba-Ming and her story of the Old Rat Woman. He lets off a small chuckle as he now finds this situation ironic. The Old Rat Woman is another goddess from his homeland, a secretive one. Now he is here, being sworn to secrecy.

"I am not sure I quite understand. What am I to never tell a soul of?" He stares back into the captain's eyes as he says this, a knowing glint flickering across the sheen of his purple iris.

Machiq stands up, resting a paw on the bed while reassuring his balance. He still feels wobbly so he stays leaned against the bed. 
"What is the meaning of this? Why have we survived? The MagniWatch people of all..?"
Machiq's voice is still weak and shaky.
