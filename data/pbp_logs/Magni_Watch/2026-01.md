**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 11:19:07):
You gather from the constant yelling of her name, to get her attention that the woman is called Ama Uomi.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 11:20:36):
Ama Uomi's head snaps toward the tiny detective on Ama's shoulder. 

For a moment, Ama Uomi looks like Ama might swat Báyakan away.

Ama blinks, focuses her eyes behind her glasses on the badge.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 11:21:31):
Ama's expression shifts from harried, strained and overwhelmed to a different look:

Desperately relieved.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 11:23:42):
Ama Uomi says quietly, just louder than a whisper:
"Finally. Real help. Special guards, like the statue."

Ama Uomi catches herself as if she had spoken quite out of turn and says very formally, bowing: 
"I am Ama Uomi, project coordinator for the Lantern Lodge. 

This is... well, it was....umm... supposed to be.....it WILL be the Minkaian Trade House."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 11:25:02):
Ama Uomi gestures sharply at the not even 1/7th finished tower, the not even started traditional Tian-Xia "garden area" with empty pond holes, etc all encapsulated behind the tall red walls that border the property.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 11:29:43):
Ama Uomi:
"Please let me explain what this chaos is all about.

A few nights ago, our night shift workers (five Minkaian stonemasons) just completely vanished. 

We reported it. 

Nothing happened.

I suppose your forces were too busy dealing with that garden party situation...."

Ama Uomi's eyes once again go wide with embarrassment and realisation, Ama bows, saying:

"My apologies, I didn't mean to imply anything against your honour.
Anyways....
Then THIS morning, our kobold labour crew (they call themselves the Stone scales) decided to barricade themselves inside the ground floor."

Ama Uomi's expression turns worried and serious:
"Guards, please, they have hostages. 
The morning shift workers who arrived before we realised what was happening.

How were we to expect this?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 11:31:36):
Ama's voice drops, exhaustion and frustration bleeding through. 
A hint of anger at the edge of her speech:

"They're demanding back pay. 

Compensation for 'unsafe working conditions.' 

And..." 

Ama laughs a bitter angry laugh:

"A formal written apology from the Lantern Lodge."

Once again, Ama Uomi's eyes flash with worry behind her glasses:
"They say if anyone tries to force entry, then they'll collapse the support beams. 
Bring the whole thing down on everyone inside."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 11:32:00):
Ama Uomi:
"Please. Please save my workers."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 11:32:28):
Ama Uomi looks at Kitt, confused:
"Did you know this was happening? You brought an interpreter.....?"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-01-03 11:38:45):
Kitt looks a bit surprised and shakes their head.

"No ma'am, not at all. But I would be happy to do whatever is necessary to get this resolved peacefully and with no more damage then has already been done."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-03 14:58:55):
Akuma more less just stands and listens. His mind keep playing out scenarios of storming in the building at various points, only to have the building crumbling down shortly after. 

I really have to start working on less violent solutions to these sorts of problems... he thinks to himself.

**Wren** (2026-01-03 19:27:42):
A creaking sound is heard as the gargoyle folds his arms across his chest. Then he expresses his concerns, while unblinkingly keeping eye contact with the Uomi:
,,Certainly I might be not well versed in local building standards, but where I come from four people going missing at a construction site in one day would normally result in discontinuation of the undertaking.”

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2026-01-03 21:36:09):
Nadya mostly fails to hide her frustration with the situation. She manages to stop from rolling her eyes, but the maneuver gets cancelled into a hybrid mixture of a facepalm and pinching a nerve between her eyes.

"All those problems are for the justice court, we're city guard. We need to focus on the hostages and those kobolds holding them."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-04 00:38:17):
"Right!" Akuma eagerly agrees with Nadya. His enthusiasm quickly fades as he follows up, "How do we de-escalate without forcing entry?"

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2026-01-04 00:54:43):
"Exactly what I am trying to establish. Having all the facts helps when considering the angle to play."

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2026-01-04 01:08:31):
"Have you any that are good for talking? I rather like sending a "translator" to negotiate. At least initially. And if you're up for it, Kitt."

The little fellow has clearly not given up on Ama for possible answers, but drugs just have such a variety of uses...

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2026-01-04 01:15:18):
"Oh yeah, I love those. Took one just a minute ago actually."

She smiles and winks, and a literal spark flashes briefly next to her head.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2026-01-04 02:09:44):
"It works great, as long as you don't mind, like, temporarily forgetting your age, or the capital of Taldor, or what you ate for lunch."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-01-04 05:15:07):
"Those don't sound like the good drugs, at least for on-duty. Maybe on break later."

Kitt pipes up before tilting their head up and up til they can see the little detective up on the tall woman's shoulder.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-01-04 08:17:54):
Kitt is taken by surprise by their reaction and looks at the ground where they spit for a moment before shifting their gaze back to their new co-worker.

"I didn't mean it to be insulting. I'm sorry. I'm supposed to make your job easier too so I shouldn't be questioning you like that."

They bow their head in apology for several moments before lifting back up.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2026-01-04 08:34:45):
"No, no, it's... ugh. Damn it."

Nadya looks away.

"Sorry. I'm not used to having... coworkers."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2026-01-04 08:47:49):
"Thats just the third or fourth time this group has had a reaction like that to my attitude around this stuff. I already feel useless having to work this beat compared to my last assignment. We can... okay we can talk about this, but later. There's literally hostages. Sorry."

She steps away and starts about packing her pipe with flayleaf.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-01-05 10:27:12):
Kitt sighs and turns back to Ms Uomi.

"I apologize for that unsightly display. I was just assigned to this squad so I was not aware of my teammates or their training. I promise I will not make that mistake again. However, if there is anything at all you can share about the crew and their complaints, valid or not, it will help me greatly in doing my job."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 12:03:31):
Ama Uomi seems surprised by the emotional and strange conversations of the group.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 12:03:48):
Ama Uomi:
"I....let me check my notes."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 12:04:09):
Ama Uomi starts fingering through a notebook that was previously kept in her spacious bag.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 12:15:37):
*[image]* One of the Athamarus walks up to Ama Uomi and passes Athamarus a note.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 12:16:54):
Ama Uomi reads the note and says cautiously:
"The front stairs were guarded by the kobolds.
They had crossbows locked and loaded, some firearms and rocks on makeshift catapults."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 12:17:12):
Ama Uomi continues:
"But....
It's gone quiet.
No one is there now."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 12:18:45):
Ama Uomi looks up properly from her note and looks over to the beautifully carved marble steps that lead up ten feet to a simple arbour made of dark wood, which marks the temple’s entrance. 

Two red wooden posts rise up on either side of the base of the stairs and connect by an elaborate crosspiece to create the impression of a gateway.

**Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07** (2026-01-17 18:39:08):
"So the heavily armed kobolds have retreated inside? That seems strange. Did you already give them an answer of no regarding the backpay and apology?"

The tiny fellow seems visibly vexed by the concept that an apology and due back pay are being made to sound like impossible asks.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-20 19:53:42):
"Maybe they found themselves in trouble?" Akuma injects, "We did originally come here for missing persons; we have yet to find out how they have gone missing."

He begins to make his way towards the stairs, arms raised just in case there are kobolds watching to see if anyone is attempting to storm the building.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2026-01-20 21:39:30):
Nadya shifts her weight back onto one leg and warily watches Akuma advance.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 15:34:19):
> Too quiet.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 15:34:28):
> Changer's eyes flicker.
>> - "Tactical assessment: Defensive withdrawal is not consistent with hostage negotiation protocols."
>> - "Probability of ambush preparation: High."
>> - "Recommendation: Proceed with caution. Kobolds are known for trap construction."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 15:34:54):
> From somewhere deep inside the building, a single voice calls out in Common—high-pitched, almost sing-song:
>> - "Come in, come in! The Stonescales welcome Magnimar's finest!"
>> - "We have SO much to discuss!"
>> - "Just... watch your step."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 15:35:14):
> A pause. Then, quieter, in Draconic (audible only to those who speak it).

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 15:35:27):
@RyoYamakawa Does Kitt speak Draconic?

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-27 18:05:45):
((@ArtyArtillery said they have draconic and can translate, what them kobolds saying?))
