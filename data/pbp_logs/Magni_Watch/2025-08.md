**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-08-04 15:26:47):
Lysandra attempts to frighten the monster with a glare as she stalks towards it, but the lengthening claws on her hands and the growing fangs throw off her usual look. So she just bites it instead.

**Eimer Hone** (2025-08-07 19:01:29):
Zilde goes towards Rusty and then spell strikes with the phase bolt longsword

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 19:02:12):
Rusty is unconscious.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 19:02:16):
COMBAT OVER.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 19:02:21):
+1 Hero points for the party.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-09 14:07:00):
So next...

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-09 14:13:33):
Machiq lowers his pistol and walks up to the Magniwatch people. "Th-thank you for taking care of that beast. But.. it was too late, it already destroyed my shop! All my guns.. gone! Except the ones I carry by me luckily. Can I file a report with you?" 
Machiq sounds desperate.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-08-09 14:21:35):
The big centaur, Lysandra, speaks through her slowly subsiding fangs from the mutagen as she sheathes her blades. “Of course. What is your report?”

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-09 15:57:33):
"I wanted to report all the damages that happened to me as that thing rummaged about. Would you follow me?"
If followed, Machiq would guide you to his store near the blacksmith's. 
The wooden interior appears fine, save some scratch marks, but you can see some rusted pistols, repeaters and other firearms.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-09 16:51:17):
However a nearby disturbance stops this report midway.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-09 16:54:43):
Parva heads into their own weapon shop.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-09 16:55:07):
Parva is heading away from the sounds of fighting and destruction nearby.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-08-09 17:31:51):
Lysandra draws her blades and takes off towards the sound of the altercation.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-08-09 18:14:52):
Is it possible for me to take a moment to observe and Hunt Prey on one before combat begins?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-10 01:43:08):
They are distracted.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-10 01:43:15):
Devouring the flesh of the corpse.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-10 01:43:38):
"Chomp, chomp, chomp, slurp, chomp, slurp, slurp, crack, chomp."

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-08-10 01:48:48):
Lysandra will point at the one on the right. “Leave that one to me.” She’ll Hunt Prey on it, then wait for the others to arrive and get into position.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-10 15:10:32):
"Can I help? I know how to fight!"

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-08-10 15:23:25):
Lysandra shrugs and looks at Nadya. “As many things have been popping up all over the place lately, we probably could use some extra hands,” she whispers. She turns back to Machiq.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-08-10 19:23:32):
Nadya shrugs. "Just dont die," she says. "It'll make us look bad if you do."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-10 20:10:30):
Do yous engage the hyenas?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 14:43:50):
Ok what happens next? :)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-11 15:27:15):
Machiq nods and gets into position behind the others.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-11 16:48:44):
Akuma places himself towards the front of the group and draws his blade. Glancing around, he feels that everyone else is prepared and proceeds to whistle at the dog-like creatures.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-15 21:40:55):
*[image]* Akuma strides forward into the pair and swings his blade twice at one of the animals. Only one of his two swings lands, and his second swing carried more force than he had grip, causing his katana to fling out of his hands. He sees the blade is okay, and sort of huffs at his carelessness, but his real intent was to draw their attention to him, so he does not worry.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-15 21:41:18):
Stride->Strike->Strike. End of Akuma's turn

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-08-15 21:51:21):
*[image]* Lysandra dashes forward to the far side of the hyenas so that she's flanking them with Akuma and lunges forward to pierce the injured hyena with her longsword.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-08-15 21:51:35):
(Any chance that finishes it?)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:53:26):
Almost.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-08-15 21:54:16):
*[image]* Lysandra slashes the hyena's leg with the flyssa in her left hand, hoping to hobble it and send it into unconsciousness.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:54:52):
@Revan1734 

You knock out the hyena.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-08-15 21:56:22):
*[image]* As she knocks out one, she turns to the other and tries to fix it with her glare, but just ends up laughing at how ridiculous it looks now that it's alone (Reaction, You're Next, but a natural one that's not really worth a hero point)

**Eimer Hone** (2025-08-15 22:14:46):
(I can’t do rolls atm if someone can do them)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-15 22:16:13):
*[image]* Machiq whacks and pushes a button on, pushing his Laser Pistol into Overdrive. 
(Rolled a 22; Success)

"Get your weapons ready!"
Machiq shouts, getting everyone to Ready Arms (2A).
He then shoots at the Hyena with the pistol.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:22:41):
But as combat ends.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:22:55):
Something is happening at the Penguin exhibit!!!!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:23:03):
SO the Magni Watch rush to the penguin exhibit.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:28:47):
The Magnimar Menagerie - Frigid Shores Exhibit.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:28:52):
The centrepiece of this macabre tableau is an expansive ornamental pool, 
its crystalline waters now fouled with crimson tendrils and drifting plumage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:28:57):
Intricate clockwork mechanisms hum beneath the surface, 
their brass gears and copper piping are designed to maintain arctic temperatures through a network of frost-enchanted coils.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:29:01):
The pool's northern and western perimeters are flanked by elegantly carved marble benches, 
their surfaces etched with protective runes that once kept visitors comfortable despite the magical chill.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:29:06):
The pool plunges a full ten feet deep, 
its bottom lost in murky darkness despite the magical illumination above.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:29:10):
Occasional ripples disturb the surface without any apparent cause, 
and careful observers might notice the bloody detritus seems to swirl in slow, 
deliberate patterns,
as if something large moves through the depths below.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:29:15):
Artificial icebergs: masterworks of transmuted stone permanently enchanted with enduring elements.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:29:19):
They rise from the bloodied waters like jagged teeth.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:29:25):
Their surfaces gleam with an unnatural blue-white luminescence, 
powered by embedded continual flame spells modified for cold radiance.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:29:30):
Around the pool's rim, 
life-sized automaton penguins crafted from blackened steel and mithril stand sentinel, 
their top hats and bow ties, 
adding a grotesque whimsy to the scene.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:29:34):
These mechanical marvels were designed to waddle and perform simple tricks, 
but now they stand motionless, their arcane engines silent, 
several bear deep gouges and dents, as if struck by something powerful emerging from below.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:29:43):
Atop the largest crystalline berg, 
a lone surviving penguin, 
it is a magnificent specimen from the Crown of the World's most remote reaches.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:29:47):
The penguin shrieks in primal terror.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:29:55):
Its obsidian beak opens wide, 
revealing the pink interior as it calls desperately for its slaughtered colony.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:29:59):
The bird's eyes dart frantically toward the water's surface, 
particularly near the pool's northern and southern edges, 
where the carnage appears most concentrated.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:30:10):
Chunks of torn flesh and scattered black-and-white feathers float like funeral confetti across the pool's surface, 
while magical preservation enchantments keep the carnage fresh and the stench potent.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:30:15):
The distribution of remains suggests methodical feeding rather than random violence, 
bones picked clean with surgical precision, bodies consumed with the efficiency of an apex predator.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:30:18):
The surrounding plaques, 
crafted from enchanted copper that adjusts its text based on viewer comprehension, 
still cheerfully dispense "educational" information about arctic wildlife.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:30:22):
Most are laughably inaccurate fairy tales.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:30:26):
Though one of these plaques correctly notes these creatures were captured from the Crown of the World's ice floes by Magnimar's exotic animal traders at considerable expense in both gold and blood.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:30:32):
The entire exhibit reeks of death, 
brine, 
and the ozone tang of disrupted magical energies.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:30:36):
Every few minutes, 
the water's surface breaks with barely perceptible bubbles, 
as if something below draws breath before descending once more into the crimson depths.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:32:01):
The penguin's shrieking screams is what alerted the Magni Watch to arrive.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-16 14:08:21):
What next? :)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-16 21:17:45):
Machiq walks around cautiously, looking where the danger might be. Pistol loaded and ready.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-18 03:49:21):
Please roll a Perception check as the air grows thick with tension, the metallic scent of blood mixing with the ozone crackle of disrupted magical energies...

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-18 06:52:25):
*[image]* (Should maybe be a 24(?)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-18 08:03:13):
Machiq grabs a nearby rock and tosses it over into the water, hoping to get the creature's attention to that.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-18 08:06:52):
A giant viper lunges out of the water and bites you.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-18 08:26:47):
As the party rushes to the next part of the zoo, you go past various cages that are still locked.

Various creatures fill these cages, many of them howling and agitated behind the bars of their enclosures.

A statue of a monkey leans out of one cage, its stone arm extended between the bars.

The statue is a monkey who reached through the bars for the escaped cockatrice and got turned to stone.

These carts contain the zoo’s less fantastical creatures, gathered from all across the Inner Sea region. 

Current residents include raccoons, toucans, a giant porcupine, meerkats, an archaeopteryx, and a “carbuncle” that, upon closer observation, is actually an iguana with a fake gem glued to its forehead.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-18 08:29:26):
As you run past the owlbear exhibit, your Magni Watch badges glow and absorb some items into the party's stash.

Some of the items that were abandoned when patrons fled the menagerie. 

These include various coin purses containing a total of 15 GP, a low-grade silver short-sword, a shiny orc knuckle dagger, and 25 GP worth of rings and necklaces.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-18 08:37:52):
The party rush on.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-18 08:38:04):
Entering the South Hall of the Zoo.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-18 08:42:55):
> The South Hall - Magnimar Menagerie
>> - This expansive corridor stretches between imposing mahogany double doors reinforced with Magnimarian ironwork, their brass handles dulled with corrosion and suspicious stains. 
>> - The hall's vaulted ceiling bears frescoes depicting the city's exotic animal trades, now marred by long streaks of acidic damage that have eaten through paint and plaster alike. 
>> - Along the eastern wall, two massive enclosures stand as monuments to catastrophic failure. 
>> - Their wrought-iron bars, once enchanted with permanent mending and reinforced with alchemical treatments, now display grotesque wounds where something has systematically dissolved the metal from the bottom up. 
>> - The corrosive damage extends in deliberate swaths, as if whatever caused it possessed both hunger and malicious intelligence. 
>> - The northernmost cage resembles a macabre sculpture garden. 
>> - Dozens of petrified rats lie scattered across the floor in twisted poses of terror—some caught mid-flight, others frozen while clawing desperately at the dissolved bars. 
>> - Their stone forms capture the exact moment of their transformation, eyes wide with primal fear, mouths agape in silent screams. 
>> - Fragments of shattered stone indicate that several victims have been trampled or deliberately broken since their petrification. 
>> - The southern enclosure tells a different tale of violence. 
>> - Rotting straw mingles with pungent hyena dung, creating a nauseating cocktail that permeates the air. 
>> - Deep gouges in the remaining bars suggest frantic escape attempts, while dried blood and tufts of coarse fur cling to the twisted metal. 
>> - The acidic dissolution here appears more recent, with edges still faintly smoking and releasing acrid vapours. 
>> - The western wall showcases the menagerie's prized collection of exotic specimens in gleaming glass display cases mounted on articulated brass arms that once allowed for optimal viewing angles. 
>> - Several cases have been violently shattered from within, their crystalline fragments scattered across the floor like deadly confetti. 
>> - The intact cases still hum with preservation enchantments, their magical fields keeping their occupants in suspended animation.
>> - A writhing mass of prismatic centipedes, a cluster of gem-scarabs that pulse with inner light and an unsettling creature called a Zog, its tentacled snout pressed against the glass as it watches with far too intelligent eyes. 
>> - Something terrible has afflicted the hall's remaining inhabitants, transforming them into vessels of pure malevolence. 
>> - Near the southern doors, an almiraj—once a creature of whimsical forest magic—now embodies perverse corruption. 
>> - This oversized rabbit's pristine white fur has taken on a sickly yellow tinge, and its spiral horn gleams with oily, unnatural sheen. 
>> - Pustule sores weep black ichor where some unknown disease has taken hold, and its once-gentle eyes now burn with predatory hunger. 
>> - The creature's breathing creates visible puffs of toxic vapour in the cool air. 
>> - Above, a flash beetle the size of a house cat circles the hall in erratic patterns, its bioluminescent abdomen strobing with diseased light. 
>> - What should be a warm, natural glow has become a harsh, seizure-inducing strobe that casts twisted shadows and makes the petrified rats appear to move in the peripheral vision. 
>> - Dark veins spread across its carapace like a web of infection.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-08-18 11:41:38):
Lysandra will move forward to flank the rabbit with Gijo. Her eyes narrow as she swings the longsword towards a weak point, striking it. (Stride->Hunt Prey->Strike)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-18 15:30:15):
Changer looks at Machiq and says in his booming mechanic voice:
"Does anyone have the ability to stop the rat man from bleeding out?"

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-18 17:12:14):
*[image]* Kneeling down to the fallen Ratfolk, Akuma places a hand on its chest. 
"The gods are not done with you yet, little one. Stand and fight."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-18 17:15:04):
*[image]* After seeing the wounds begin to close on his comrade, Akuma, with surprising speed for a man of his stature, dashes up to the diseased animal and strikes it.
"May you find peace in your next life."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-18 17:15:44):
Lay on Hands > Stride > Strike. End of Akuma's turn.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-08-18 23:14:39):
Nadya grimaces at the healing done by Akuma.

"Don't try that on me, please. Egh."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-19 00:08:39):
Machiq gasps and coughs as the magic heals his wounds. He still lays on the ground as he recovers, looking up.
The anachronistic pistol lays beside him, he reaches for it.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-19 00:47:18):
In response to Nadya's remark, Akuma looks at his hand inquisitively, trying to determine the source of their disgust. Noticing some of the blood from the creature, he tries to find a clean spot of cloth on him to wipe it. 
"Sorry. I will try to be cleaner before administering aid."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-08-19 00:52:34):
Nadya laughs and turns away but she remains visibly uneasy.

"Clean is good, but if you try magic like that on me i'll fry from the inside out. If i'm ever bleeding out and you try something like that you'll be delivering a coup de gras rather than helping."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-19 00:58:22):
Stunned by the statement, Akuma nearly drops his sword as his mind tries to assemble all the pieces of this revelation. The gears in his head churn quickly, but it becomes apparent that there are not enough of them to come to a complete conclusion. 
He firmly grips his blade before it slips out of his grasp entirely, and pushes the thought aside, figuring that he doesn't need to know why, so long as he knows not to do it.
"Understood."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-08-19 03:33:11):
"Good. That being said, it seems to have worked fine on the ratfolk. Whaddya say, you dying still over there or nah?"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-19 03:57:20):
Machiq takes a deep breath and sits himself up, holstering his pistol again.
"I'm happy I did not end up like the knight in the Montague Python play."
He sighs and slowly stands back up, dusting himself off.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-19 04:05:03):
The party doesn't have long to rest, but you could squeeze in a quick 10 minutes.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-08-19 04:05:49):
Over ten minutes I got 3 doses of 10 hit points from elixirs, anyone who wants em grab em

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-19 05:06:38):
Machiq Takes a Breather

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-19 05:09:57):
Remember that in combat you can get half your stamina back for free every turn.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-19 05:10:20):
(not at home rn. Won't be until thursday)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-20 21:44:20):
So do you continue onwards?

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-20 21:46:47):
Akuma focuses on his surroundings, trying to determine which direction the closest threat is.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-20 22:36:24):
The rabbit's horn is glowing.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-20 22:38:57):
*[image]*

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-20 23:14:12):
Noticing the glow, Akuma nudges the rabbit with his foot. "This thing IS dead... right?" He asks as he kneels down and grabs it by its horn.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-21 18:08:29):
With the horn shifting in his hand, Akuma tosses it to the ground in fear that it was some trap or creature, only to be amazed by it no longer looking like a horn but a half-formed blade. 
"Did you guys see that?" He asks as he picks it back up. It finishes shaping itself into a weapon he is more familiar with, a katana. With curiosity getting the better of him, he imagines a different weapon, and the "horn" changes into a large studded club. 
"Awesome..." He mutters to himself, and a large smile spreads in pleasure across his face. The horn shifts back into a katana with a motif of rabbits with horns imprinted across the sori. The ito wrapping the ivory tsuka is white and looks as soft as a rabbit's fur. The tsuba seems to be made of gold and is of two, horned rabbits chasing one another.
"I'll call it... Little Rabbit."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-21 23:30:40):
What next? :)

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-21 23:34:52):
"Shall we move on?" Akuma asks, impatiently, wanting to try out his new sword. He slowly starts moving towards the next area of the zoo, but making sure to not leave the others behind.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-21 23:36:47):
Machiq follows up, raising this shield, hoping not to get walloped by animals again.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-23 08:45:34):
If the party are ready to continue, after your 10 minute rest...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-23 08:51:33):
The Magni Watch continues.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-23 08:51:44):
You find yourselves at a room at the end of the hallway.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-23 08:51:58):
The door is blocked with barrels, chairs, etc.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-23 08:52:16):
DC 14 athletics check to move the objects blocking the doors.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-08-23 21:42:52):
"This stuff is probably a fire hazard, at least. What are people blocking doors for? Surely nothing good."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-08-23 21:42:53):
*[image]*

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-08-25 05:57:30):
Nadya walks up to and knocks on the doors.

"Anyone in there? We're making sure no escaped beasties got into here."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:27:38):
Nadya.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:27:42):
This is the zoo's reptile room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:27:46):
There are two entrances: a Northern and a Western door.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:27:50):
The group are entering through the Northern doors.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:28:00):
The western doors have been hastily barricaded with broken timbers.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:28:04):
Along the walls of this room, the snakes hiss and slam against their glass enclosures.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:28:08):
You push into the extremely warm chamber, and the first thing you see is the people.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:28:12):
There are a dozen frightened patrons and several exhausted-looking zookeepers, all huddled together inside a rusted animal cage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:28:15):
The cage that shelters the survivors stands open and broken, its painted jungle backdrop faded and mocking, its iron bars eaten through with rust.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:28:18):
Their faces snap toward you with wide, desperate eyes, relief and fear warring in their expressions.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:28:18):
You also notice a heavy stove in the corner that blasts suffocating heat, making the air thick and oppressive. 
The mechanical furnace has magical runes carved into its metal. 
This furnace allows the snakes to survive in Varisia's climate.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:28:29):
Upon seeing the group two of the zoo keepers leave the cage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:28:53):
A male and a female zoo keeper.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:29:40):
Telomand (male):
"Oh, thank the gods, the guards are here!
I'm Telomand, and this is my colleague Raisa (female)."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:30:32):
Raisa:
"How is it going?
Have you captured or killed all of the animals?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:30:53):
Telomand:
"I couldn't believe the aggression.
Those creatures are normally docile!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:31:24):
As the zoo keepers talk to the party a patron of the zoo leaves the cage against the protests of the other zoo keepers and patrons.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:31:33):
He is a middle aged male human.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:32:44):
Nil:
"Guards, please.
I know there is much for you to do, but you must find my son.
Jerov and I got separated in the chaos!
I can pay, I have gold!
Have you seen my son?"

Nil hands you a photo of his son.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:33:10):
The party does not recognise him amongst the living or the dead found so far.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 07:35:51):
Telomand ignores Nil and says:
"If you've made it this far then you've done exceptionally well.
There is only the Manager's office, the veterinarian's wagon, the rust monster exhibit, the ankhrav exhibit and the supply shed left to check.
Which would be the order you'll get to them if you do them from closest to furthest."

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-08-25 10:16:12):
Lysandra speaks up. “We’ve subdued a rust monster. Are there more?”

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-25 10:40:08):
"Are there still any animals that could roam around.
We took care of a cockatrice, an owl bear, hyenas, a scarab and a horned rabbit, the rust monster, a viper..."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-25 10:42:36):
Machiq glances over to the direction of the snakes that slammed themselves against the walls. 
"Snakes normally don't do that, right?"

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-08-25 12:46:40):
“We need to wrap this up. It’s quite possible someone agitated the animals and set them loose as a distraction for something occurring elsewhere in the city. Are there any animals potentially loose besides those?”

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-25 15:06:33):
"What on Akiton's Scrapyard is an Eldamon?"

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-08-25 15:37:28):
“The more pressing question is ‘What is an ankhrav?’”

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-25 16:45:45):
Akuma stands vigilant, keeping himself aware of his surroundings, letting those with silver tongues and sharp minds perform the questioning.
Even so, he finds himself getting closer to the furnace, curious about the runes.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-08-26 16:39:46):
“We need to find and subdue this beast. Then we can see if anything has been happening elsewhere.” Lysandra turns to the worried civilian. “Once the last beast is subdued, your son will be safe.”

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-28 09:27:58):
Do you all continue then?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-28 09:29:46):
You continue down the other corridor.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-28 09:29:52):
Until you come to a locked office.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-28 09:30:18):
This is the furthest point of the indoor areas before you finish your loop of the actual animal exhibits.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-28 09:30:30):
The door has a plaque reading: "Archibald Knight: Manager."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-28 09:30:55):
You can Force Open the door with a successful DC 15 Athletics check.

**Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW** (2025-08-28 11:22:32):
(Lysandra will start actively tracking the ankhrav to Hunt Prey on it.)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 09:08:40):
- Cluttered office.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 09:08:52):
- A lot of bills across his wide wooden desk.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 09:09:26):
- A set of keys for a wagon lay on the table.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 09:09:43):
- Annotated maps of the inner sea region.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 09:09:59):
- The maps detail every country in the inner sea region.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 09:10:23):
- A pull switch with a label saying "Bed" is in one corner.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 09:11:06):
- His bookshelf has hundreds of books on looking after many many many species of animals, beasts and all kinds of other creatures.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 09:11:36):
- Maps show future projects the Magnimar zoo wishes to build.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 09:12:16):
Give me a perception check from each person, DC 15.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 09:13:39):
Also, the bottom drawer of his drawer has a big heavy lock mechanism built into the drawer. 

It's open. 

It doesn't look tampered with, it looks mistakenly left unlocked.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 09:13:49):
Assuming someone opens the drawer...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 09:14:00):
Inside the drawer is:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 09:14:42):
5500 copper pieces.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 09:16:25):
An Owlbear claw talisman.

A blowgun with 30 sleep darts (treat as sleep arrows).

A lesser tanglefoot bag (glue bomb)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 09:16:30):
And a letter...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 09:17:43):
The unsent letter Larwen Knight (Archibald Knight’s wife) tells Larwen that their marriage is over.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 10:22:02):
Changer:
"This is the office of Mr Knight."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-29 10:35:39):
*[image]*

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-29 11:23:36):
(What does the date on the letter say, if it has one? With that, how much time ago was that date?)

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-29 15:00:20):
Akuma slowly steps over to the switch. He wants to know why a bed needs a switch.
As he makes his way there, he frequently checks to see if anyone notices him and if anyone looks his way, he pretends he's looking around through the mess. 
Once he finally reaches it, he flips it.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-29 16:44:27):
"Huh..." Akuma audibly says to himself. He looks at the well-kept bed and decides to feel how soft the pillows are.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-29 16:48:08):
Machiq coughs at the dust thrown up by the pop-up beds. 
"Well.. that's odd." Machiq comments. 
"Don't tell me that if you lay on the bed and pull on the lever to retract it, you're gonna get pulled into a secret room?"

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-29 16:55:52):
Akuma's face almost lights up with delight at the thought of a secret room, but he regains his composure before responding. 
"We should probably investigate that theory; we wouldn't want to leave a stone unturned."
He then lies on the bed and gives a thumbs-up to Machiq.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-29 16:56:46):
Machiq shrugs and pulls the lever again.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-08-29 19:57:49):
Nadya will investigate the map whilst those two are messing with the bed.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-31 19:23:41):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-31 19:23:46):
This should have everything looted ?

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-31 19:37:30):
After a few minutes, Machiq flips the switch again.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-31 19:38:53):
Worried, Machiq looks at Akuma. "Are you alright? What happened?"
