What next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-17 11:08:14):
What next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-18 12:42:15):
What next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-18 12:42:25):
We are not in encounter mode.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-06-18 19:23:11):
"Yeah, sure - bridge magic works. You can call it whatever you want, just so long as you recognize my authority."

Nadya allows a figment of arcane energy arc between her fingers to emphasize her words.

"Now, when the adrenaline wears off you're both going to be in so much pain you won't be able to respond properly, so do yourselves a favor and surrender now so I can hopefully treat your burns before that happens."

**Eimer Hone** (2025-06-20 16:24:25):
“Good work. Let’s get those burns healed.”

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-20 16:51:53):
So while the goblins may be passive for a moment.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-20 16:52:02):
The barrels are about to EXPLODE.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-22 16:36:19):
What next? :)

**Eimer Hone** (2025-06-27 15:17:28):
Zilde walks over to the barrels and attempts to put them out.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-27 22:56:07):
Using either thievery

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-27 22:56:08):
Or survival.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-27 22:56:09):
DC 20.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-27 22:56:12):
Please roll.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-27 22:56:14):
2 actions.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-27 22:56:16):

**Eimer Hone** (2025-06-28 01:01:02):
One by one, Zilde disabled the mechanisms, pulling each barrel and dragging them across the cobbled path to the old wooden trough where the horses drank. 

With a grunt, she lifted the first barrel and tipped it in. It landed with a splash, bubbles rising from its seams.

By the time she lowered the last one in, sweat streaked her temple and her arms trembled from the effort. But the barrels were drowned, their danger neutralized.

Behind her, the horses whickered softly, tails flicking at flies, unaware of the fate narrowly avoided.

Zilde turned, brushing dust from her coat. She gave one of the mares a gentle pat on the nose and whispered, “No one’s drinking from that tonight.”

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-28 01:02:00):
And +1 hero point for all Magi Watchers.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-06-28 01:42:40):
A large... man arrives on the scene. His armor and stature almost look regal, yet it contains the face of what can only be described as an orange-skinned demon. His head is adorned with carefully groomed, black, hair and two large horns pointing upwards. His eyes are pitch black, aside from his bright purple irises. His jawline carries a noticeable underbite, probably to better fit in the two small tusks rising from it. 
Once he realizes that the commotion has already been resolved, he looks towards who he assumes to be the highest ranked officer, salutes, and exclaims "Akuma Kami-oshi, reporting in!"

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-06-28 05:31:59):
Nadya waves casually at the new arrival. She barely attempts to conceal an appraising look up and down.

"Ah, hey. You're a big lad, hope you stick around."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-06-28 15:35:23):
A little surprised of the relaxed and observant nature of the individual in front of him, Akuma's salute falters a bit. His eyes begin to dart about, as if trying to avoid eye-contact. 
He eventually takes a deep breath and releases his salute entirely. "I have been assigned to this unit. I will assist you all in anyway possible."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-06-28 20:31:50):
"You already get your badge and everything? Because I can give you something to do right now, if so."

As she speaks, Nadya is rummaging through her chirurgeon supplies and reagents.

**Eimer Hone** (2025-06-28 21:25:45):
“Akuna, welcome. Hope you are ready to keep up.” Zilde smiles and reaches out to shake their hand

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-06-28 22:00:33):
While reaching out to shake Zilde's hand, he responds to Nadya's question first. "I have received my badge."
He then firmly grasps the hand and stares at Zilde intently, giving it a solid shake. "And I won't let you down."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-06-28 22:55:03):
"Good, mind holding these goblins down while I treat em? I don't favor getting bit, and this is definitely going to hurt. And make sure that if they do bite, you add that to the list of charges."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-06-29 03:57:42):
"Consider it done."
Akuma steps up to the first goblin, he ponders for a moment on the best way to restrain the individual without inflicting further harm while giving access to Nadya.
It didn't take too much thought for him to decide to slip behind the goblin and put him into a firm chokehold. He made sure to not squeeze too tightly, preferring to allow it to bite him in struggle over suffocating. Akuma used his other arm and legs to pin its limbs as necessary. 
"There, there. I'm sure it will be over swiftly."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-06-29 04:48:32):
"Takes about a minute."

Nadya squats down and finishes the alchemical mixture she had been working on. She pours the liquid into the goblins mouth before splashing another vial over the goblins wounds.

"You are gonna be high as the heavens for a bit there kid."

She pulls a small cloth sack of flayleaf out and starts to set it into a pipe, offering the sack over to Akuma once the goblin settles down.

"You smoke?"

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-06-29 14:40:01):
"I do." 
Reaching towards the bag, Akuma pauses and a hesitant look appears on his face. He eventually withdraws his hand.
"Could I take you up on that offer after our shift?"

**Eimer Hone** (2025-06-29 17:45:04):
“Maybe best. Don’t want to annoy the Lieutenant anymore. We all done here now? Everyone happy?”

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-06-29 20:29:38):
"Suit yourselves. Lieutenant ought to be happy as long as we do our jobs. We can probably get away with just fining these two since no one else got seriously hurt, yeah?"

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-06-29 20:40:57):
Akuma glances around for a bit before giving a sort of half-nod. 
"I will have to defer to your judgements, I wasn't here to witness anything other than the aftermath."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-06-29 20:52:50):
"Well, battery is a felony. Assault is a lesser felony, reckless fire magic... technically this was alchemical but either way it's a misdemeanor. Lots of property damage, at least two broken city golems. It seems pretty clear this is a situation where one of these two might claim legal exemption justified via defense of life, or if they manage to think about it for two seconds together they might both claim this was a duel which just got out of hand, which would turn things down from several felony charges just down to the reckless fire magic and some public endangerment stuff. But just in case they don't do that, we're supposed to take interviews and document witnesses here, ensure some degree of initial officer position, fill out all the paperwork for the rest of the day and maybe a good chunk of the night..."

She lights her pipe and takes a long drag.

"Or we can fine them and move on."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-29 21:56:47):
From their bank accounts and into the party's bank account go 30 Gold Pieces.

Along with: 
2 x Clubs.
4 x lesser alchemist fires.

**Eimer Hone** (2025-06-29 21:57:26):
“Let’s fine and go. I’m sure there is plenty to be getting on with.”

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-29 21:59:01):
As the group continues your patrols across the lowcleft district...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-29 21:59:04):
You hear a yell!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-29 21:59:31):
A man yells out:
"Guards! Guards! Thief! Stop her!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-29 22:02:17):
The group sees a large man in sweat dripping merchant's robes huffing and puffing after a woman who is rushing away from him at very very fast speeds.

**Eimer Hone** (2025-06-29 22:04:24):
Zilde goes up to the man and woman. Assuming the group is behind. “What’s this all about.”

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-29 22:09:40):
Ahead of him, cutting through the crowd with predatory grace, runs his quarry. 

The woman is the man's opposite in every way: lean, quick, and dressed for function over form. 

Her dark hair is cropped short and practical, streaked with premature silver. 

She wears fitted leather that's seen better years, clearly functional gear. 

What catches your perception trained eyes is the subtle equipment: 
a bandolier crossing her chest holds what look like hair ornaments and small tools, but you suspect they serve more practical purposes. 

Her movements flow like water around obstacles, clearly born from years of dancing between law and lawlessness.

The crowd parts before both pursuers and pursued, some diving aside in alarm, others pointing and shouting, a few of them laughing at the spectacle. 

The thief's eyes dart constantly, calculating routes and exits. She's clearly experienced at this but the crowds that provided cover for her crime might now prove her undoing. 

She's running straight towards the group, unaware that the very guards her victim is calling for are already in her path.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-29 22:09:41):
The narrow streets pulse with chaotic energy. Gas lamps flicker in the shadow of the ancient Irespan overhead, their flames dancing behind smoked glass. 

The air thrums with industrial machinery while street performers compete with amplification crystals and enchanted instruments. 

What do you do?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-29 22:10:17):
You can stop her sprinting escape with a DC 15 Acrobatics or DC 15 Athletics check.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-06-29 22:12:27):
Akuma would like to attempt an Athletics check to block her path. (He has a +7 modifier.)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-29 22:24:21):
Can everyone roll please?

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-06-29 22:30:34):

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-06-29 22:30:50):
Nadya would kinda wait for everyone else to do this before she does though lol

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-29 22:37:05):
Her throat slammed she stammers back before the group.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-29 22:38:25):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-30 02:28:14):
Player side first.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-30 02:28:49):
You are assumed to have weapons drawn as you were given heads up by this.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-30 02:41:04):
BUT

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-30 02:41:32):
The woman strikes a frightening look right into your eyes Nadya. @ArtyArtillery

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-30 02:41:43):
You are frightened one.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-30 03:53:28):

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-06-30 04:09:48):
This adventure is fire so far fwiw

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-06-30 05:18:50):
Nadya makes a snide remark about speed being a silly thing to value when you're face down in the dirt, then casts command (prone) on the thief.

(I do not fully know if I did things right BUT the foundry indicates that the bon mot failed but the command worked.)
