**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-01 20:03:57):
What happens next?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-11-05 16:52:40):
Rubel will take 20 min to dissarm the rope trap...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-12 16:57:39):
The tree guardians seem to lay down and fall asleep.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-12 16:57:52):
Congratulations, take a hero point Rubel.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-11-12 17:07:32):
Rubel will continue towards the arches while keeping an eye for maybe more alarms?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-11-12 17:12:30):
He will continue to advance until he is in reach of an arch or he finds a trap.

**Eimer Hone** (2024-11-12 17:16:05):
Anaiel follows behind carefully

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-13 03:10:52):
You both stand in the centre of the room.

The device buzzes in Rubel's pocket.

You all feel a very faint magical energy from the arches, but nothing particularly intense.

What happens next?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-13 18:57:24):
The tips glow various colours at their tips from a source of light beneath their spongey surfaces.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-13 18:57:42):
They all point towards the closest arch.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-13 18:57:57):
To complete the activity you'll need to scan all the arches close to them, do you do so?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-11-13 19:03:25):
/roll 1d20+4

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-11-13 19:03:33):
Arcana check(NAT 20 let's GO)
He wants to know how it functions and how to operate it so he doesn't inadvertently break it.
(So for example does he have to stand in front of a portal or does he need to go through and stuff like that)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-14 12:49:11):
What happens next?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-19 02:47:39):
What happens next?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-11-19 03:04:56):
Rubel will start approaching the closest arch with the device until it "starts recording" and wait until it ends and then move on to the next arch etc.
Since he got new feats he has trap finder now so you can roll a perception check whenever he gets close to a trap to see if he triggers it.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-11-19 03:07:01):
Rubel should have +6 expert perception probably since he is a rogue.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-11-19 10:18:05):
Rubel will leave with the rest of the party(i guess).
Is he able to rearm the rope trap?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-19 10:21:02):
What happens next? :)

**Eimer Hone** (2024-11-19 12:15:50):
What is it finara? Asks Anaiel

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-19 20:16:54):
"Illusion and no Conjuration.
It confirms my theory.

"The real Seven Arches are hidden somewhere south, in the Wilewood, which is why the Oakstewards restrict travel there.

They also post guards. 

Far too many for a forest.

They are hiding the arches.

Years ago, rumours have spread that exactly seven guards felt compelled to walk through the real seven arches. 

Never seen again, except for one.

A year ago one returned, a self-righteous Oak-steward druid named Bolan. 

When he got back, Bolan was a changed man... and not in a good way. 

The high council of seven arches questioned him but his memories were sealed, no magic could read them.

Then they raged at him for shirking his post, causing them to cover up the guards disappearance or else the secret hiding spot could be uncovered.

So he stole an important Oaksteward artifact and hid out in the Wilewood along with some other malcontents, evil druids, traitors, etc.

Well, or so the rumours go.
All of this I've pieced together.

I've heard he's been sending cronies to the city to harass the citizens, undermine the Oakstewards’ authority, and recruit other discontented druids and other magic users to his cause. 

His ultimate aim, as far as I can tell, is a full-on takeover of seven arches."

Fianara concludes with gravitas: 
"I don’t know what happened to that Bolan dude when he went through the arch.

But whatever he knows, I figure you’ll want to know it, too.

Because he went missing when you all went missing."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-19 20:24:32):
This all takes place in an alleyway outside of the grove.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-20 23:45:29):
What happens next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-24 23:23:09):
Fianara pulls out a BIG book.
It is a very high quality old tome.

It is durable, waterproof, bound with iron overlaid with silver, and locked.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-24 23:23:46):
Fianara tries to hand you the book Rubel.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-24 23:25:57):
As she does she says:
"This is a bound book, a very expensive book.
Fill it with the tales of your adventure and all of your findings for research!
Promise me you'll do that...and give me my book back?"

Fianara smiles awkwardly:
"It is very expensive, the doctor gave it to me haha."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-24 23:26:04):
Do you take the book?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-25 21:13:54):
@MrNegetZ 

Do you take the book?

**Eimer Hone** (2024-11-25 21:25:34):
Anaiel smiles at Fianara. 

“We promise to fill it up with tales and research. And of course give it back.” 

She reaches out to take the book off Fianara.

**Eimer Hone** (2024-11-26 16:51:19):
“Shall we travel to the Vine Hall?” Anaiel asks

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-11-26 17:25:22):
"Yeah let's go!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-26 17:58:13):
So what happens next? :)
