The party crosses the rope bridge.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 06:17:02):
You open the door.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 06:17:09):
You find yourselves in a workshop.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 06:18:20):
This workshop is a complete mess. 

Workbenches and pegboards cluttered with tools line the walls, while half-finished wooden carvings and strange contraptions are scattered across the floor. 

On the eastern side, someone (or something) has knocked over several shelves and piled the debris into what looks like a makeshift nest. 

Doors on the north and south walls open onto rope bridges.

To the northeast, a spiral staircase winds up around a tree trunk within a rounded chamber.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 06:24:42):
You hear the sound of a creature coming around the corner...

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-10-17 09:51:28):
The lumbering minotaur steps forward, gently making his way through the mess and his companions.
"We mean no harm. We are simply wishing to go further into the treehouse so we may speak with Bolan. If you allow us through we will be more than happily be out of your way."

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-10-17 09:57:59):
(Imagine Twilight just leaning past your legs as you say that)

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-10-17 09:58:23):
He gives a lil wave

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-10-17 15:28:41):
"We want to talk to him so we would prefer to not have to. But we will defend ourselves if necessary."

Glit:
"Kill Bolan, don't kill Bolan.

If you let me stay, finish my building, create my designs.

You can take this..."

Glit opens a chest containing...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-21 03:43:23):
Does the party accept or decline?

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-10-21 03:51:25):
"I don't see why not. Though, if you don't mind answering, what are you building?" Cyrus looks around the workshop at the various items and contraptions in various states of construction.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-10-22 16:17:57):
Axtra skitters about the room, looking at everything with a sense of wonder. She catches herself more than a couple of times reaching out towards a contraption or carving, only to quickly pull her arm back before actually making contact.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-10-22 23:46:40):
"That sounds rather dangerous, maybe moreso for the creator than the resulting items themselves. I would hope you reconsider your goal in time, but if not then that you at least stay safe and be careful in who you choose to let wield them."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-10-23 00:33:40):
As Axtra leaves, she gives a nervous wave while saying, "Sorry for being a pest. They are really pretty."

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-10-23 02:20:34):
Twilight trails the rest of the party and gives a quick farewell to glit, "Bye, Mr. Chaos Smith."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-10-23 03:13:28):
Cyrus packs away the artisan tools and magnifying glass carefully before falling in with the rest of the party to move forward.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-23 06:22:14):
Do you all proceed up the stairs? :)

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-10-23 08:03:38):
I think so?

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-10-23 17:09:35):
Please
