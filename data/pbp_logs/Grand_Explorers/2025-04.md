**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-05 22:21:13):
Ok so, are the party going to go up the stairs into the fortress?

**Eimer Hone** (2025-04-09 19:21:28):
“Prisoners we are then. Leading the way?” Anaiel questioned

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-04-09 22:06:08):
"How do you expect me to sneak my way in? I stand out quite obviously afterall."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-04-09 22:25:00):
"Perhaps you could distract them somehow?"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-04-10 01:27:11):
"I don't really like that idea, but if it has to be done then it has to be done.  But if something goes down and I can't see or hear it we need a signal. Something loud or bright."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-13 20:03:59):
@MrNegetZ 

Roll stealth twice.

Once for the approach of the fortress.

The 2nd for going up the spiral staircase.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-13 20:39:45):
You are in area 1: the gatehouse.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-13 20:39:58):
Rubel is at the top of a spiral staircase.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-13 20:40:27):
There are two staircases, one to the west and one to the north.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-13 20:40:59):
The wardens are looking at the stone on the western staircase, they can't see you.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-13 20:41:12):
There is a sleeping pangolin in a cage next to you.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-04-13 20:43:01):
Are they close together?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-04-13 23:52:32):
"Let me out!" Scrit shouts out in frustration.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-14 23:50:10):
The druids come back over to their positions near the windows.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-14 23:50:22):
And resume guarding the approach.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-14 23:50:34):
They are about 3 metres from you, backs towards you and the cage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-14 23:50:50):
@Askarans you are awake and see Rubel.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-14 23:51:08):
*[image]* Rubel's token.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-04-16 00:56:50):
Scrit nods and stands back, but stays ready to attack if needed.

**Dean Young** (2025-04-16 19:22:24):
(((when can I join?))

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-17 21:30:09):
So what happens next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 00:48:50):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 21:21:06):
Rubel hits for 13 damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 21:21:12):
Punching the druid in the throat.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 21:21:38):
Nearly knocking the druid out from the pain.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 21:21:46):
The druid is "at death's door".

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 21:21:55):
Though in this case he is nearly at bedtime's door.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 21:23:06):
COMBAT!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 21:23:07):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 21:23:27):
Rifon turns to you and yells: 
"Intruder, Intruder!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 21:23:41):
You hear many many footsteps and yelling from around the fortress.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 21:23:48):
Rifon takes his turn.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 21:25:14):
Rifon: Wild shapes his claws and quick draw strikes you with his crossbow.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 21:27:21):
Menelimus casts Shillelagh and bonks Rubel for 6 damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 21:27:32):
Players turn as enemies approach from above.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 21:29:05):
Two leshys appear

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 21:29:10):
One shoots a seed at Rubel.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-19 22:23:50):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-19 22:23:52):

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-04-19 22:27:55):
(Does Scrit not get Initiative?)

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-04-21 04:04:27):
Upon hearing the shouts from above, Illiani only hesitates for a brief moment before sprinting towards the stairs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-29 16:29:49):

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-04-30 06:09:13):
Cyrus will Cast a Spell (Warp Step) then stride twice til he is staring down the first guard, his well polished steel shield raised up in defense.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-30 06:15:21):
You run up the spiral staircase, keeping your shoulders in tight.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-30 06:15:37):
The eco terrorist druids are SHOCKED.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-30 06:15:44):
As the massive minotaur rounds the corner.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-30 06:16:00):
The leshies seem to find this mor amusing.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-30 06:17:58):
@CryVito 

Is your last action raise shield ?

**Eimer Hone** (2025-04-30 23:03:20):
Anaiel follows behind and sprints up the stairs. 

Near the top she takes her rifle and tries to shot the target. 

Then she casts thunderstrike
