**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-02 16:57:00):
Axtra pushes the door open carefully.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-02 16:57:23):
A wall of humid, iron-tasting air rolls out. 

The room beyond is cramped and loud.

The constant groan and hiss of pressurized water echoing off slick wooden walls.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-02 16:57:46):
A massive funnel-shaped vessel dominates the centre of the room, beaded with condensation. 

It swells outward near the ceiling, connecting to a much larger catchment tank mounted on the roof above. 

Dozens of copper and brass pipes, each one covered in gauges, clockwork spigots, and pressure dials snake out from the tank along the floor and walls in every direction like mechanical veins.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-02 16:58:01):
Some of the pipes run along the floor. 

Others disappear through the southern wall toward the sealed central building.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-02 16:58:51):
On the southern wall, near where the pipes exit toward the central building, there is a large brass valve wheel clearly labelled in Gnomish. 

A heavy clockwork mechanism connects the valve to the pipes.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-02 17:00:30):
Perception check to look at this water system.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-02 17:00:45):
Engineering lore / crafting to assess the system.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-02 17:01:08):
Society or linguistics lore to try to read the labels.

Or if you have gnomish, you can just read them.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-02 17:01:22):
Also there's a door to what appears to be a broom closet.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-06 21:14:22):
*[image]* Cyrus will attempt to help with the translation of the label as well since he normally has a knack for languages.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-06 21:23:52):
*[image]* Axtra will squeeze between the other two to see what they are doing. The lettering isn't something she genuinely knows, but she does recognize some familiar patterns within the writing. She tries to read it to the best of her ability, using the context of the area.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-06 21:28:59):
*[image]* And although her specialty is weaving, Axtra also has a fair bit of general knowledge of various other crafts and constructions. She attempts to assess the system.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-12 07:19:23):
@ArtyArtillery @RyoYamakawa @Linksanelf2006

Between the three of you, you decipher the words and the 
Gnomish script comes into focus.

The largest label on the brass valve wheel reads:

"Main Flow. 

Hydraulic Seal Release."

Smaller labels on individual pipes read things like:

"Pressure Line 3" 

"Overflow Return"  

and 

"Emergency Vent."

@ArtyArtillery 
Illiani, something catches your eye as you study the system. 

The main tank is bulging. Slightly, but unmistakably. 

Condensation runs in thick rivulets down its swollen sides. 

The gauges nearest the base are all sitting deep in the red. 

This system is dangerously over pressurized. 

Turning that valve right now would be a terrible idea.

@Linksanelf2006 
Axtra, the whole system clicks into place for you like a well-made loom. 

The pipes that run through the southern wall connect to a hydraulic lock mechanism on the other side. 

The reinforced doors to the central building. 

This valve is how you get in.

But the pressure has built up far beyond safe operating levels. 

At first to think that nobody has maintained this system for a long time. 

But then you realise that they have, the gnomes have taken great care over this engineering marvel.

This is intention: but why?

An emgency lock.

A final desperate option.

You can see three emergency vent valves along the main pipe runs. 

Bleeding those first, carefully and in sequence, would make the system safe to operate.

Rushing it, forcing it, or just cranking the main wheel without venting... 

Well ... 

Let's just say you don't want to think about what that much pressurized water would do in a room this small but the word "boom" comes to mind and probably a vision of you all very dead.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-12 08:05:51):
.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-12 15:08:01):
Axtra will inform the group of this safer method of releasing the pressure of this contraption.

"If we do that, we should be able to access that other room."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-14 15:26:17):
"Well... I'd prefer to take the actions that doesn't cause this thing to explode, so..." Axtra begins to turn the emergency vent valves in their correct sequnce, carefully.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2026-02-14 21:18:15):
Illiani begins backing away out of an abundance of caution, and also to observe the outside to make sure the group isn't getting ambushed or something.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-02-15 01:18:41):
Cyrus backs off a bit to allow Axtra space to work while still keeping watch just in case.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2026-02-15 01:43:37):
Rubel checks around the broom closet door.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-16 01:05:01):
You will need 3 successes.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-23 10:26:38):
23 is a success.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-23 10:26:41):
18 is a fail.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-23 10:26:50):
@Linksanelf2006 

Hero Point reroll?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-23 10:31:00):
@Linksanelf2006 

For the 21 in crafting...

Axtrakeela, look at the valves.

You calculate how to release the pressure to disable the water system.

You spin some of the taps then grab the main wheel.

A quarter turn.

Steam hisses through the seal, sharp and hot, fogging the air around your wrist.

The heat is intense.

The pressure, both on the water system AND the pressure you face are both immense.

The nearest gauge drops out of the red.

Success.

Lower pressure but the danger remains.

Second major valve.

You turn it.

It moves, but wrong.

The seal slips under your fingers and the valve spins loosely without catching.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-23 23:27:17):
If the aid isn't possible or fails, I'm good with rerolling.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2026-02-24 01:11:55):
*[image]* Nvm it was 25/75 for a crit only +1 might not be enough.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-02-24 08:32:53):
If you gave them a +1.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-02-25 19:05:27):
Okay, I will reroll.
