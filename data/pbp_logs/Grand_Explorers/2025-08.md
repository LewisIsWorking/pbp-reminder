**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 17:31:25):
You ride your spider up the ladder.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-02 17:35:16):
(Does the Spider count as an Animal Companion or Pet or what?)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-02 17:35:33):
(As in the Feat)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 17:41:15):
*[image]* The party find themselves in the poison lab.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 17:41:46):
A library and a laboratory.

A room of books, glass vessels, burners, and other distilling
equipment.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 17:42:09):
There are two doors, sealed from their other sides: impassable, for now.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 17:42:17):
However there are plenty of alchemical loot.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 17:42:29):
You raid the shelves.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 17:42:30):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 17:42:34):
SENT TO PARTY STASH!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 17:42:54):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 17:43:16):
And you go back down the ladder.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 17:43:46):
You continue North.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 17:43:57):
Opening the door the party find themselves in a dining hall.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 17:44:20):
The room is dominated by a long table covered in plates, cutlery and all kinds of musical instruments.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 17:45:04):
You hear two tiny voices:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 17:45:13):
???:

"Bow foot, now!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 17:45:22):
???:

"But chibs, the music!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 17:45:31):
???:

"PUT the instruments down and FIRE!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 18:05:01):
Two creatures jump out at the end of the room: one a grig and the other a sprite.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 18:05:04):
They seem intent to kill.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 18:05:07):
COMBAT.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 18:05:47):

Round 1

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-02 18:59:55):
As the combat begins, Scrit's defensive instincts activate and he enters a Rage.
Afterwards he moves to a position to where he can see the the critters. 
Through Quick Alchemy, Scrit creates a Blasting Stone which he lobs at the Grig.
Which misses. However as the stone hits the ground, a deafening sound erupts from it under the Grig. It takes 1 Splash Damage and needs to make a Fort Save, the Sprite as well, as the loud boom is still deafening enough for it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 19:04:42):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 19:05:46):
@Askarans 

18 and 18, they both succeed.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-02 21:11:40):
Anyways, Rubel goes, he tries to divert the attention  of the sprites with a trick but fails (he still gains panache). He was sneaking so they are still surprised by him(surprise attack), he lanches his cold-iron starknife at one of the sprites using confident finisher.
Then he calls out to anyone that wants to go Cyrus (@RyoYamakawa ) using one for all to give him a +1 to his next attack and gaining panache again (or anyone who plans to attack can steal the +1 if they come first).

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 21:13:25):
Crap

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-02 21:14:03):
Rolled the wrong damage so i rerolled...

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-02 21:14:37):

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-02 21:14:37):
*[image]*

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-02 21:14:51):
*[image]* One for all normal success so a +1 for the first to take it tbh even though i targetted Cyrus @RyoYamakawa .

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-08-06 23:08:52):
*[image]* Cyrus moves forward  and swings his sword at the sprite, The tight constraints and the relative difference in size makes the blade look like it will not hit its target, but he manages to adjust the arc mid-swing landing an ungraceful, but clean hit. He then raises his shield in preparation.

**Verge (#5) | Teberon** (2025-08-07 01:56:01):
Verge will move around the table, drink a drakeheart Mutagen and raise shield. (My AC should be 21 but it be buggy)

**Eimer Hone** (2025-08-07 19:06:40):
Anaiel casts Electric Arc (2 actions). Bowfoot dies from the small electrical shock as he was already on the edge of death. Anaiel then strikes with the rifle (using one shot, one kill). One shot to the head.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 19:08:07):
^ Both are killed by Anaiel.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 19:08:09):
COMBAT OVER.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 19:08:18):
+1 Hero Points to the whole party.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 19:08:46):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 19:09:01):
Instrument loot sent to party stash.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 19:29:43):
You hear struggling sounds from the poison lab!!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 19:30:02):
@Askarans Scrit your spider wants you to check it out.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-09 13:14:41):
So it's a bass

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-09 13:14:45):
A 4 stringer

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-09 13:14:53):
With a low pitch

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-09 13:14:57):
That resonates more

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-09 13:16:17):
.... Uh?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-09 13:18:25):
Btw this thing didn't exist before 1930 so it's kinda out of place

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-09 13:20:54):
Maybe it's a double bass?

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-09 15:18:03):
Aren't double basses weirdly large to carry around though?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-09 17:14:57):
Anyways guys.

This is the play by post channels.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-09 17:15:18):
@StorybookRhizome 

The sounds of combat have ended below, you are still fully restrained.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-09 17:15:25):
You should be able to shout though.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-09 17:15:50):
Though this may also attract your captors.

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-09 17:18:40):
Twilight will struggle a bit more before yelling out, "Hello?! Anyone out there?"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-09 17:37:12):
Scrit follows the spider, leading him to the coccoon. 
"Oh my plates..!" 
"I will help you!" Scrit begins to disassemble the coccoon.

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-09 17:41:23):
He sits up a little woozily, wooden arm held up to his head, "Oh, thank you! But I don't supposed you know where we are?"

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-09 17:42:15):
"Or the bear that ran me over?"

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-09 19:16:05):
"I'm not quite sure where that is. Then again,  I'm not quite sure of anything at this point"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 14:43:36):
What happens next?
:)

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-11 17:49:36):
Twilight stands up, brushing the remnants of webbing away. He takes a moment to check himself over for injuries and 
takes stock of whatever things he still has on him. He seems a little nervous as he asks, 
"So, anyone know the way out of here?"

**Verge (#5) | Teberon** (2025-08-12 01:32:43):
"nope, we are kinda just wrecking through everything"

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-12 01:46:30):
He seems to perk up a little when you mention the druids, "Oh, I can help with that! As thanks for getting me out of those webs and all."

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-12 01:49:23):
His posture droops as he thinks of something, 
"Could they be behind how I ended up here?
I guess I have answers of my own I need to find..."

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-12 03:27:44):
Twilight very much winces as you say that, but tries to interject some levity in his words, 
"Shall we get looking for answers, then?"

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-12 03:28:03):
"If you don't mind me tagging along, that is."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-12 10:13:21):
You all notice that Laetheron has a whale tattoo, like (almost) all of you do.

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-12 19:48:55):
I'm gonna imagine it's on his right arm, unless you have a specific place you want it

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-12 19:51:18):
Twilight will think. "I don't remember having anything like that." But also chalk 
it up to the general weirdness going on and add it to the list of other stuff
to figure out

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-12 19:53:14):
In the interests of moving things along, Twilight's gonna clap is wooden limbs together, give himself a quick pep talk, and just wander out of the lab. Unless someone wants to talk to him

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-14 00:59:57):
Anyone else coming with?

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-14 18:18:16):
Scrit follows behind on his new Spider friend.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-08-15 00:28:10):
Cyrus starts following behind the two small ones, between cages and webbing he is getting sick of these people and their methods.

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-15 01:48:24):
"Errr." He makes an awkward sound as he steps out, "You all seem more familiar with this place than me, anyone have an idea where we should go next?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:13:02):
Do you cross the rope bridge to the North?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:13:03):
*[image]*

**Eimer Hone** (2025-08-15 22:16:09):
Anaiel turns to Rubel and says “still we just cross, what’s the worst that can happen?”

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-15 22:44:53):
"The bridge crashing."

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-15 23:15:56):
Twilight looks up and chirps, "As long as we go one by one, it'll probably be fine!" And he peers over the fence. "Probably."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-16 16:26:05):
"Fine. I'll go ahead." 
Scrit dismounts from the spider and walks along the bridge carefully, checking the stability on each step.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-16 16:34:39):
Scrit holds a hand against the door. Does he feel any creature behind it? (Tremorsense 30ft)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-16 16:38:50):
This looks to be a storage room.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-16 16:51:35):
Scrit opens the door.

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-16 18:42:48):
Twilight will cross after Scrit does.

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-16 23:24:14):
Anything fun in there?

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-16 23:25:45):
Scrit begins to explore the storage room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-18 03:54:14):

Added to the party stash.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-18 03:56:31):
There is a door to the North-East.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-18 03:56:52):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-18 03:57:02):

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-18 04:07:12):
Twilight will crack open the door and stick his head in, if he can

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-18 04:27:28):
it occurs to me that this is the first roll I'm gonna make, is there a way you want me to do that?

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-18 04:47:03):
World 1 is open rn

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-18 04:57:58):
npnp

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-18 18:45:11):
*[image]*

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-19 01:14:52):
Twilight will think, "well, at least it looks like some people are enjoying themselves." Before he softly closes the door and tells the party, "there are two pixies having a party on cake in there."

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-22 03:52:29):
"Think we can just walk past them?"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-08-22 04:24:22):
Cyrus looks at himself and his over 8 foot tall frame and back to Laetheron. "That might be a tall order for some of us."

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-22 04:38:11):
Twilight looks you over from top to bottom and says, "Hey. You can do anything you put your mind to."

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-22 04:40:45):
"But I see your point. Hmm, if I were them and a bunch of people were walking past while I was eating sweets, I'd mind my own business. You think they'd do the same?"

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-08-23 07:27:46):
"If we can manage to avoid more fighting, its worth a try. They might be upset that we've bothered them, but maybe they're not associated with the, um... the terrorists."

Illiani looks doubtful but appears to be trying to keep an optimistic mindset.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-23 08:53:45):
What do you want to do next?

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-23 16:53:53):
"Terrorists?"

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-08-23 21:19:16):
"Oh, yeah. Its not why we came here in the first place exactly, but the people who took this treehouse and turned it into this fort really need to be stopped. It seems like they have a grudge against elves in particular but it really sounds like they want all of civilization to fall, and they do seem to have some kind of plan to do it."

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-23 21:48:48):
"We should probably hurry then. Shall we?" Twilight gestures at the door.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-08-24 04:20:30):
"Let's go then. Everyone be ready just in case." Cyrus hefts his shield and grasps his blade.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-26 03:39:42):
You see something move in a large jar in the room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-26 03:39:52):
The distracted fairies are turning to talk to whatever is in this jar.

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-26 03:48:52):
Is there a way we can see into the jar from the doorway?

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-26 18:21:30):
*[image]*

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-28 22:14:34):
Axtra stops banging on the glass and attempts to communicate with the faeries. "Uh... Excuse me." She yawns. "I seem to be stuck in here. Can you let me out?"

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-29 10:34:57):
Or is it too heavy/far?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 11:16:26):
It's more than 1 bulk.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-29 11:19:33):
And it's actually invisible unlike mage hand

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-29 11:20:17):
I'm pretty sure it still counts as 1B even if it's 1B9L

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 11:45:56):
It's a larger than human sized glass jar.

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-31 00:54:31):
Unless anyone objects, Twilight will step forwards and ask the faeries, "Would you might letting that person out of the jar? It doesn't seem like they like it very much."

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2025-08-31 00:54:49):
He does know Sylvan, if that matters

*[image]* Scrit walks up towards the entrance door, then with Quick Bomber, quickly draws a Bomb and throws it at the lower of the two tiny pixies, before returning back to his previous position.
The splash hits both Pixies.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-31 20:33:42):
