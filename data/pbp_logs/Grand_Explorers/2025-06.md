@MrNegetZ 

Could you take Horia's turn?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-22 16:43:19):
World #2 is open now if you want to / can.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-06-22 16:46:15):
Movement: 20ft to get to the staircase? 10ft left.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-06-22 16:47:14):
Would get him 2 squares up the stairs or 1?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-06-22 16:48:37):
Assuming 2.
2nd movement: He gets up behind Scrit.
3rd action: Hunt prey on the druid caster/summoner that has the snake?.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-06-22 16:49:50):
*[image]* Should end up in the red square

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-06-22 17:06:58):
Wait.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-22 17:07:02):
?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-06-22 17:07:46):
She isn't placed on the field?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-22 17:21:57):
Oops I never actually moved her and did the turn for her.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-22 17:23:09):
*[image]* @HistoricallyInaccurate 

Her speed is bugged.

Should be 35.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-22 17:23:19):
Base land speed 7....

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-06-22 18:02:30):
Don't forget 1 shot 1 kill for her first strike.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-06-22 18:04:41):
Also can't she move where Aekold is standing. Shoot and then step back( does she have enough movement?)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-06-22 18:05:09):
(nvm)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-06-22 18:05:45):
Place is a bit cramped with Cyrus...

Anaiel does 1 damage.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-06-22 18:52:11):
1d6+1d4 I think

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-06-22 18:52:35):
From slinger's precision and one shot one kill

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-27 14:59:04):

As Anaiel Black-Steel gets punched in the face the leshie's fist covers her in thick slowing vines. -10 speed for one round.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-27 23:10:48):

**Eimer Hone** (2025-06-28 00:51:28):
She then casts thunderstruck on to Leshy and turns them into ash

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-06-28 05:32:24):
*[image]* As the leshy striked out with the vined fist and makes impact with Anaiel a holy, blinding light flashes from Cyrus and engulfs the foe and Anaiel. Its radiance hardens Anaiel's body at the point of impact while simultaneously confusing the leshy's vision. (Ally Resists 3 damage for the triggering hit and causes dazzled and off-guard for 1 round on the foe.)

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-06-28 05:32:25):

Successfully, Scrit manages to grapple the Leshy.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-06-30 05:26:18):
Illiani moves up to get a good shot, focuses herself into a flow state, and lets loose a few arrows towards the enemy on the bridge.
