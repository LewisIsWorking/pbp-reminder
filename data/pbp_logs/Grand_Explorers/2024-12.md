An angel blooded dwarf druid approaches the group as you enter the busy courtyard of the vine hall, the group sticking out quite considerably.

The dwarven oak steward asks:
"What's your busy here lads?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-12-02 15:23:00):
What happens next?
:)

Anaiel smiles before speaking.

“We have been recommended by Fianara to come here.”

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-12-19 14:41:39):
The dwarf leads the group through the halls of the vinehall to a large hall covered in vines, the angel blooded dwarf says:

"Welcome to the place where the vinehall gets its name."

The great hall has many burning fires, long tables filled with druids, some doing paper work, others tending to plants, other feasting and making merry.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-12-19 14:42:26):
The dwarf says:
"Stay here a moment."

He does not return.

Instead a horse covered in leaves, mud, bird nests and, of course, vines approaches.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-12-19 14:43:11):
Off it's back comes a halfling druid wearing ceremonial robes befitting of high office in the ranks of the oak stewards.

The halfling says:

"I am Lemma Feldthorn, you are here about the arches, huh?

Well then, tell me what you know and be quick about it.

I have food that needs eaten and duties that need tending to."

**Eimer Hone** (2024-12-23 20:08:01):
“We are here to find the seven arches.”

**Eimer Hone** (2024-12-26 19:51:16):
Anaiel grips her wrist. 
“What do you mean changed. How so?”
