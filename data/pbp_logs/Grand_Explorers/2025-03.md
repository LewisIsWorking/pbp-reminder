@RyoYamakawa 
@Nemesiux 
@ArtyArtillery 
@MrNegetZ 
@HistoricallyInaccurate

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-02 20:44:14):
*[image]* Rubel moves behind dog2 for his first action:

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-02 20:56:44):
*[image]* He strikes it in the back hitting it for 13 damage.
He will then advise Cyrus:
" Hit it while it's still recovering! "
using One for all to aid him.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-02 20:57:59):
Rubel will gain panache from this.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 21:18:31):
DOG 2

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 21:18:37):
Attack of opportunity.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 21:18:38):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 21:18:42):
You LUCKED out.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 21:18:46):
10 damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 21:19:17):
Dog 2 takes bonus damage from the COLD IRON weapon!!!!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 21:19:35):
16 damage!!!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 21:19:45):
Dog 2 is not feeling good.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-02 21:39:48):
Using a hero point

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-02 21:39:55):
Yeah

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-02 21:52:22):
*[image]* He strikes the injured creature, his blade initially not penetrating its hide but with some added effort it makes a clean slice (Hero Point roll so +10 for a 23, 10 damage)
He then uses the momentum of that extra push to bring the blade around to the one who felled his companion, striking true. (10 damage)
He then raises his shield in preparation for a possible response.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-02 21:52:23):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 22:00:09):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 22:00:11):
@RyoYamakawa

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 22:00:26):
Dog 1 is not feeling good.

**Eimer Hone** (2025-03-02 22:24:48):

**Eimer Hone** (2025-03-02 22:25:04):

**Eimer Hone** (2025-03-02 22:25:18):
*[image]*

**Eimer Hone** (2025-03-02 22:26:18):
Anaiel takes her Rifle and tries to shot the dog from where she stands.

**Eimer Hone** (2025-03-02 22:26:41):
Then she casts thunderstrike

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 22:37:51):
The dog fails the save.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 22:38:00):
8 damage from rifle.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 22:38:10):
When I roll the save it auto rolled damage: 10 damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 22:38:14):
Halved to 5.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 22:38:19):
DOG 2 DIES!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 22:38:33):
Both dogs turn to a bundle of shadow leaves.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 22:38:49):
They are fey and have returned to the first world as mindless spirits.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 22:39:03):
Congratulations!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 22:39:08):
+1 Hero Point to everyone! :)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-02 22:41:18):
As the combat ends Rubel quickly huries to Illiani and administers first aid.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-02 22:41:34):
*[image]*

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-02 23:37:48):
*[image]*

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-03 00:09:48):
Illiani slowly rolls over and stands up.

"Thanks... That was sudden. What were those things?"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-03 00:50:30):
"Whatever they were they were definitely dangerous and tricky. I am just glad we were able to deal with them in time. I am sorry for not reacting in time to protect you from them."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-03 01:04:14):
"I was a little careless going ahead like that. But all the other animals in this forest have been so nice!"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-03 01:06:17):
"I still should have been more prepared. The precautions that were taken before we came here were for a reason."

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-03 03:04:17):
*[image]* "Since we entered the danger zone we better set up a marching order. I propose Cyrus and Aekold take the front, I'll be right behind you guys, then we'll leave Illinani further back and Anaiel will try to stay hidden so she can surprise any attackers. "
As he says that Rubel tries to patch himself up but doesn't seem to manage to do it well.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-03 05:56:32):
After taking a moment to rest up a little, Illiani will finish moving towards the arches to investigate them.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-03 09:20:19):
You all go towards the seven arches?

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-04 08:54:54):
I figure Illiani must be investigating in exploration activity terms

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-04 17:10:37):
What happens next? :)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-07 21:37:17):
I think we'll first take a breather to recharge stamina and then continue on.

So while exploring:
Illiani is Investigating
Rubel and Anaiel are avoiding notice
Aekold is scouting
Cyrus is keeping his shield raised.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-07 21:38:56):
We go in the marching order i said if everyone is ok:
from front to back:
Cyrus/Aekold
Rubel(keeping a low profile behind cyrus)
Illiani/ Anaiel(hiding in the back)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-08 21:07:59):
Rubel and the rest of the group progress across the tall grass, as yous move forward, you are less than 100 metres from the seven archway, each archway is seperated evenly and all of equal sizes, except one.

However, you take but one more step and something happens.

Your vision shifts to mono-colour.
Your bodies start to dissolve.
You shake with violent raw magic reactionary forces.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-08 21:08:06):
YOU HAVE SHIFTED.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-08 21:08:31):
Not to another plane but to within the illusion, this illusion spun around you was of a somewhat different, out of sync moment in reality.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-08 21:08:44):
Now the arches are randomly dotted around the centre.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-08 21:08:50):
With one still being the biggest.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-08 21:09:11):
The green lush tall grasses look dark and grim, like charcoal sketches of themselves.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-08 21:09:37):
There is a shadowy miasma around the biggest archway, it looks like distant movement.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-08 21:09:53):
EVERYONE ROLL A FORTITUDE SAVE.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-08 21:10:28):
As the planar warping starts to cause microscopic tearing into your flesh, seeping into cells and causing them to burst from planar energy.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-08 21:10:37):
:)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-08 21:12:19):
*[image]*

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-08 21:22:25):
*[image]*

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-09 00:49:35):
I you want to reroll with a hero point you right click the message and click: reroll using a hero point.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-09 00:54:44):
Yeah I'm not familiar with the VTT sorry

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-09 00:55:00):
I just did it manually

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-09 00:55:21):
Don't use that second roll we have a thing where you get a bonus if you reroll low with a hero point.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-09 00:58:00):
*[image]* Alright, this is the new result

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-09 02:04:17):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 02:13:15):
DC17.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 02:13:37):
You are both immune from the planar warping for 24 hours.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 02:13:42):
And take no damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 02:13:48):
Who is left?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 02:13:49):
@HistoricallyInaccurate

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 02:13:53):
And ?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 16:50:17):
@HistoricallyInaccurate 
@Nemesiux

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-09 16:50:26):
I am busy

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 16:50:31):
We are likely to roll your fortitude saves for you if that is ok ?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 16:50:32):
@Nemesiux

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-09 16:50:40):
sure

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 16:51:09):
@MrNegetZ There you go then, roll 2x Fortitude saves.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 16:51:19):
1 for @HistoricallyInaccurate 
1 for @Nemesiux

**Eimer Hone** (2025-03-09 18:54:13):
*[image]*

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-09 19:07:55):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 22:33:43):
No one took any BIG damage! :D

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 22:35:34):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 22:36:35):
As yous settle down after the planar energies leave your body you see the following:

Besides the displaced arches,
3 wild unwashed crazy looking oak stewards wearing strange esoteric coloured prismatic masks are sacrificing a unicorn.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 22:37:00):
The unicorn is clearly heavily sedated with what looks like magic and dangerous narcotics.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 22:37:42):
A slime tall woman was cutting the unicorns throat but now both the two older men's attention and her's are on the party.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 22:37:58):
She wasn't slitting the unicorns throat, more bleeding it dry slowly.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 22:38:02):
COMBAT.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 22:39:00):
Best ally initiative: 25.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 22:39:12):
Best enemy initiative: 18.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 22:39:17):
Allies go first!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 22:39:33):
Who wants to start?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 22:39:43):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 23:04:15):
*[image]*

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-09 23:05:24):
As long as the lanes are kept relatively clear so I can do my Champion duty without using a Friendly Nudge I will go last amongst the party.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-09 23:41:50):
Rubel and Anaiel managed to avoid being noticed for now(probably).

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-09 23:54:19):
*[image]* Out of nowhere one of the stewards gets critically hit by a Starknife to the hand.
Rubel now spotted will draw his rapier and will call out to Aekold.
"Go while they are still figuring it out"

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-09 23:54:19):
*[image]*

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-09 23:54:55):
*[image]* Using One for all he will give a +1 to the next roll for Aekold and gain panache.
END TURN
Aekold @Nemesiux next?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-10 00:08:56):
Rubel.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-10 00:09:10):
You stab him through the eye and your star knife BURSTS out the back of his skull.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-10 00:09:35):
He is dead. Very very dead. ONE SHOT, ONE KILL.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-10 00:09:51):
The other oak warden SCREAMS:
"YOU KILLED HIM, BASTARD, YOU'll DIE FOR THAT!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-10 00:10:16):
The woman seems hesitant to fight after watching her ally get SMITED.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-10 05:13:02):
*[image]* Illiani steps forward and strikes at the oak steward closest, aiming to incapacitate them rather than kill.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-10 05:27:41):
(And then she casts a shield spell)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-10 20:14:08):
*[image]* Since @Nemesiux doesn't do it:
Aekold takes his turn.
Hunt prey on the cultist
Stride behind him:
Twin Takedown:
Hit(non-lethal)
Miss
Damage = 7 (technically 6 since i tried to see if the nonlethal trait would be applied).

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-10 20:14:30):
*[image]*

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-10 20:14:39):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 02:05:50):
7 + 8 damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 02:06:00):
He is unconscious.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 02:06:07):
@Nemesiux You knocked him out.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 02:06:20):
With a BONK to the head the 2nd rebel is knocked out.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 02:06:31):
The woman drops her dagger.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 02:06:48):
The female oak steward says:
"OK OK OK OK, please stop."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 02:08:01):
She removes her mask and continues:
"RIGHT Ok. My name is Korimona."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 02:09:00):
Korimona says:
"Look we are on different sides here but I can help YOU and I don't wanna end up like Dizzy there."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 02:09:15):
Korimona looks at the mashed in skull of her ally.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 02:09:31):
Korimona:
"Nor do I want the brain damage that Cloud just received."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 02:10:37):
Korimona:
"Right, also I am assuming you'll not be letting me do the sacrifice, right?
If not you'll need to calm down that unicorn before it has a heart attack, no point in it dying not for the greater good."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 02:12:27):
Korimona:
"I am guessing you were sent by Seven Arches.
I knew they would send some force at some stage but I was expecting some druids or something less, well, mercenaries.
Not exactly warriors of nature are you lot?"

Korimona sighs and continues:
"You lot are here for Bolan, right?"

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-11 02:54:52):
*[image]* Illiani moves up to the unicorn and tries to stop the bleeding.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-11 02:55:30):
"And what kind of greater good was this poor thing supposed to die for?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 02:59:34):
Korimona sighs again:
"Well, firstly, you will need to cut it loose to calm it down, unicorns are magical beasts of freedom, they cannot be calm when restrained."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 03:02:42):
Korimona continues:
"I know you lot won't understand, the druids of seven arches CERTAINLY never did.

The curse of seven arches.

The elven cancer curse.

The ROT of elven kind.

Elves are one of the most primal attuned races in this forsaken world.
We are trying to use ritual-lite magic to manipulate the curse to affect civilisation, NOT elves.
Though those traitorous elves who have succumbed to the blight of URBAN life should also ROT and die."

Korimona goes from sounding like she barely cares to almost frothing at the mouth in rage by the end of this piece of conversation.

Korimona calms down, clearly realising how she sounds.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-11 03:08:50):
Illi will try to focus on her task but still shakes her head listening to the hateful speech of the primalist. She'll mutter a short prayer as she cuts the unicorn free.

"Song of the Spheres guide my hand, help me stay this creature's suffering."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-11 03:16:21):
On hand she could try with an arrowhead but If that doesn't work she'll try to take whatever knife the woman was using to sacrifice the unicorn.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 03:20:50):
It springs up.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 03:20:53):
It is PISSED.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 03:20:58):
Roll nature.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 03:21:05):
To came the unicorn.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 03:21:13):
Or else it will try to hurt you.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-11 03:21:52):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 03:29:45):
Your psychic senses tell you that the calmed unicorn ( currently gazing into your eyes) is trying to use it's own latent magic to read your connection to nature and the forces of good.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 03:29:49):
@ArtyArtillery 

What is your alignment ?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 03:32:35):
*[image]*

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-11 03:33:46):
Shoot maybe, but not if it bleeds out first lmao. For now she's satisfied if the unicorn just lets her help it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 03:33:56):
Unicorns normally only bond with women and this is one of those moments.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 03:34:09):
@ArtyArtillery 

You can roll medicine now, the unicorn will let you tend it's wounds.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-11 03:35:42):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 03:37:55):
The unicorn is no longer bleeding.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-11 03:54:14):
"You're right, we were sent after Bolan, but it sounded like we were hoping to avoid violence."

Illi glances over at the bodies.

"This isn't the best start."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-11 04:00:58):
"On my way northwards from my home I passed through a deep and ancient wood called the Verduran. They have a treaty with their civilized neighbors that has lasted centuries, Andoran is included."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-11 04:16:52):
Illiani bites back a response and takes a brief moment to center herself.

"Can you bring us to Bolan? Or at least tell us where to find him?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 04:19:10):
Korimona:
"Yes."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-11 04:22:57):
Turning back to the rest of the party,

"Any thoughts?"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-11 05:43:17):
"We must be careful, of course. But for now we should listen and if she will lead us to him we shall follow. And when we find him we shall try not to have to take a path of violence, but it may come down to it."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-12 00:16:58):
He turns to look at her directly. "And? Am I saying something objectionable? Violence in this case was to help the unicorn. If we had encountered each other in another situation I would have preferred to talk first and maybe work something out between us. And I still would like to avoid violence going forward. It is not because of some belief of superiority. It's just that the beauty of nature shouldn't be bespoiled by such actions when not necessary."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:30:11):
What happens next? :)

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-13 23:31:51):
I'm happy to let Korimona lead us towards Bolan at this point. I don't have any exploration stuff I want to do that would keep us from moving.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-16 03:08:52):
We should probably also take the unconscious one as well, I just remembered him. Illi will check on the dude to see if he's definitely stable. But even if he's fine we probably shouldn't just let him lie there.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 04:54:29):
Korimona will lead the group through the woods.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 05:03:49):
Korimona:
"We are going to the Greenleaf Forest House."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 05:06:22):
You travel for an hour through the woods.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 05:06:34):
Then come into an even larger clearing than before.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 05:09:02):
As the forest gradually thins, it reveals an extraordinary sight: a network of brightly painted wooden houses perched high among the trees. 

These multi-story structures stand interconnected by gently swaying rope bridges, creating an elaborate aerial community. 

In the southeastern corner, a wooden staircase spirals gracefully upward from the forest floor, leading to a suspended gazebo that serves as an entrance to this elevated enclave. 

The northern end is crowned by a tower where a small windmill with canvas sails turns slowly in the breeze, its wooden mechanism creaking rhythmically.

The whimsical appearance of this treetop village stands in stark contrast to its recent defensive modifications. 

All lower branches have been methodically removed from the supporting trees, leaving bare trunks that glisten with applied grease. 

These smooth surfaces are further fortified with downward-pointing wooden spikes, creating an effective barrier against unwanted climbers and transforming this fanciful haven into a practical fortress.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-16 19:24:39):
"Do you think we could rest for a moment? My bandages are coming loose."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 16:09:54):
There looks to be sentries.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 16:10:06):
If you walk up on this gate house you are likely to be spotted & shot at.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-20 01:47:23):
What happens next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:29:23):
Korimona:
"We all know each other, yes.
And we number almost 20!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:29:50):
Korimona:
"No, the only procedure is that only we are allowed in OR ......"

Korimona trails off.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:30:07):
Korimona:
"WE are rebelling against the cancer that is civilisation!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-24 01:55:52):
What happens next? :)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-24 03:02:18):
(( It's the wrong sheet bruh
But they have the same modifier though(I'm pretty sure) ))

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-24 03:05:26):
*[image]* (( Is it a big deal? do you want a reroll @PathWars? Even though the numbers are the same ))

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-24 05:01:32):
Korimona says slowly:
"Wha....what was that?"

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-03-24 17:24:06):
"Such powerful magic would leave signs, surely. We can sense the mark on ourselves and others, but does anyone have a way to sense the presence of spells aside from that?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-26 04:13:59):
Korimona says:
"Yeah...
I get it."

Korimona pauses then says:
"Right, what do you need to know again?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-26 04:14:10):
Korimona *sounds* like she may be more helpful.

**Eimer Hone** (2025-03-28 18:27:27):
Anaiel steps forward. “Maybe we should give it a go together and fight.” 

Her voice although quivering as she is hesitant with her answer.
