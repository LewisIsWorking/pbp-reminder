**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-06 23:57:28):
*[image]* The drawback of his larger body in the confined space preventing him from moving forward he settles for casting Soothe on Rubel, the calming energies sealing his wounds. He then raises his shield, readying himself to protect his allies in any way that he can.

**Eimer Hone** (2025-07-07 00:23:10):
Anaiel takes her rifle and tries to shot the closest terrorists. 

Then she casts thunderstrike

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 00:40:45):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 02:12:53):
?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-07 02:13:37):
Or is there already an alarm going on?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-08 03:53:17):
What next? :)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-08 03:54:18):
Sensing that somebody else is nearby, Scrit carefully walks forwards across the bridge. 
There he sees a man.
And the man sees.. an upright walking pangolin. 
Probably an unusual sight for many. 
As Scrit sees the man, he squeaks, his plates rattle and tilt up in a defensive posture, as Scrit is unsure whether this man is friend or foe. His long tail is wrapped a round his torso in a defensive manner. 
There, on the tip of the tail, a tattoo.. rather an engraving, in the shape that represents the Stone Bulwark is visible.

**Verge (#5) | Teberon** (2025-07-08 04:04:23):
Verge stands motionless amid ruin and rot, straw still clinging to his back, tubes hanging loose like umbilical cords cut mid-birth. His eye flares—not hostile, but alert, alive. Processing.

Across the broken bridge, he sees movement—slow, deliberate, weight balanced carefully over clawed feet. Plates. Scales. A creature most would call curious, quaint, maybe even adorable.

But Verge doesn't see creatures the way most do.

He sees data.

Posture: Defensive.
Tail: Coiled, protecting vital organs.
Species: Pangolin—bipedal variant. Rare. Likely sapient.
And then… the mark.

His eye zooms. Focuses. A glyph etched in hardened scale.

Stone Bulwark.

It hits him like a strike to the chest—not pain, not memory… something in-between. His own shoulder burns faintly beneath the skin, the whale twitching as if in recognition.

Verge does not reach for a weapon. He lifts one hand—slowly, palms out. Still gloved, trembling with weakness. But calculated. Nonthreatening.

"...You're not part of the greenhouse," he rasps. Then, after a beat, more softly:
"...You’re like me."

He steps forward—not quite toward Scrit, but adjacent, until they're facing one another across silence and space. The tubes from his arm drag behind him like veins torn from context.

“I’ve seen that mark,” Verge murmurs. “In dreams. In visions. In… corpses.”

He studies Scrit’s eyes.

Not for threat.

For understanding.

“Did they give you a choice, too?”

And though his voice is barely above a whisper, there is a tremble of need beneath it.

Not weakness.

Recognition.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-08 04:14:09):
Scrit's scales flatten, his posture appears more loose, yet still ready to defend if necessary. 
His amber eyes glisten in the dim light of the greenhouse. 
The pointy snout turns towards Teberon's shoulder. "That tattoo. You also had this dream?"

The tail lowers, rolling across the floor. "You can move. Do you know where they hid my alchemicals?"

**Verge (#5) | Teberon** (2025-07-08 04:49:48):
Verge’s crimson eye narrows. He nods once.

“Yes. The dream. The choice.”

He glances to a shattered shelf behind him, scorched but intact vials glittering faintly beneath a tarp of straw.

“Behind that rack. Labeled in druidic glyphs.”

A pause. Then, quieter:

“They drugged us differently. But they kept us close.”

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-07-08 07:07:27):
Illiani carefully steps over the dead leshy and across the bridge. She quickly senses the mark on everyone else in the room and lowers her bow.

"Um... Hi, you're not Bolan, right? Just making sure."

**Verge (#5) | Teberon** (2025-07-08 07:08:53):
Verge turns at the sound of the voice—slowly, precisely, as if his body is still syncing with time itself. His eye lands on Illiani, scans her posture, her bow, her face. Then drops to the tattoo.

It pulses faintly in his vision.

Another one.

“No,” he says, voice low and sandpaper-rough.

“I’m not Bolan.”

He tilts his head, expression unreadable.

“Are you?”

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-07-08 07:18:45):
"Oh, no, I'm not. Sorry."

She stows her bow and raises her hands a bit in front of her.

"I'm Illiani. Bolan is another person, marked like us. He's supposed to be here - and he might know what we're all going through. But he's also leading this... um, it's like an activist group. Well, probably it would be better to describe them as a terrorist group."

Illiani seems to realize something and seems embarrassed.

"Sorry, do you already know this? You're here already, I don't know what you know already."

**Verge (#5) | Teberon** (2025-07-08 07:21:05):
Verge blinks once—slow, mechanical.

“Illiani.” He files the name away like a sample under glass.

Then he turns his gaze back toward the corpses, the garden, the vials. His voice is thin, analytical.

“I woke up in a straw bed full of Shiver needles and dead druids. My memories are three years out of date and stitched together with whale sigils and chemical hallucinations.”

He looks back at her.

“So no. I don’t know this.”

A pause.

“Keep going.”

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-07-08 07:28:18):
Illiani slowly approaches so she isn't yelling across the room. She speaks earnestly but her nerves are still frayed from the fight just a moment before, and her voice shakes slightly.

"Well, I don't know if it helps, but we all seem to have similar psychically manipulated dreams. I was able to tap into the dream of Cyrus back there during mine, and the dream seemed contiguous. Something, we have no idea yet, did this to us. We've all been waking up around this area, and it has happened to enough of us that we've managed to find each-other while we try to figure out what all of this is about."

**Verge (#5) | Teberon** (2025-07-08 07:31:46):
Verge watches her approach, eye dimming to a dull glow as her words settle into the hollows of his mind. Contiguous dreams. Shared symbols. Psychic manipulation.

His tongue is dry. His voice breaks on the first word.

“…Water.”

A pause. Then quieter:

“And food. If it’s real.”

He sways slightly, catching himself on a nearby crate. Not dramatic. Just... failing systems.

“I’ve been sustained by narcotics and dream residue. I need something solid. Something real.”

He blinks, slowly.

“And then we can talk about what kind of thing stitches minds together like thread through a wound.”

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-07-08 07:41:45):
"Woah, careful! Just sit there for now."

Illiani runs back to the bridge.

"Hey, everyone! Get in here, there's another person marked in here. Do we have a spare waterskin?"

**Verge (#5) | Teberon** (2025-07-08 07:52:29):
Verge doesn’t argue.

He lowers himself back down, joints creaking like old hinges. The straw whispers under his weight. He leans forward slightly, resting his forearms on his knees, breathing slowly.

The moment she leaves the room, he stares at his open palms.

They’re shaking.

He clenches them into fists. They shake harder.

He whispers to himself—not a question, but a command burned into ritual:

“Observe. Record. Endure.”

Then he glances at the whale on his shoulder.

“...And next time, remember.”

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-08 14:33:49):
Scrit begins to walk towards the chest himself. "There's more in there." 
He digs through the chest and finds his tools. "There it is!" 
The voice seems relieved. "Blackpowder.. Sparkbloom.." 
His voice descends into a mumble of different ingredients as he straps on his alchemical gear. 
"There we go."

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-09 00:21:39):
Rubel, Hearing Illiani's call he responds, "I got it!"
After thanking Cyrus for healing him starts hopping over to the garden, trying to not step over the bodies while apologizing quietly " Sorry... Sorry... Sorry..." .
After making sure the new people aren't hostile he pulls out his watersking and some rations.

"So.. I'm Rubel, an adventurer, and as Illiani might have explained, we all have a weird tattoo and are trying to figure out things about them, what happened is we were cared for by Finara and Doctor Ritalson who are also trying to figure out some things, but for that we needed to get to 7 arches, and the curent 7 arches, the real ones, are currently where the rebel druids are. So that's why we're here basically. Also their leader Bolan might have some answers but apparently he went a bit crazy and that's why there's this druid rebellion.  "

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-09 00:27:33):
Looking over at Scrit and his tools he says:

"Oh you're an alchemist? Is it possible for you to brew some elixirs for us? Some of us are a bit injured. We'll take a 10 minute break here since the druids don't seem to be too alerted yet.."

Looking over to the druid's belongings they just got he'll propose a plan:
"Oh looks like we got a mask, hmm, i could disguise myself with this and scout the rooms ahead, pretending to patrol, then report back to plan how we approach them."

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-09 00:33:36):
Rubel will take a breather to regain stamina and i suggest Anaiel @HistoricallyInaccurate also do .

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-09 00:42:53):
After Scrit put on his gear, he shakes himself briefly, making sure everything sits.
Then he turns around. 
"Oh, yes. I know some Alchemy. While my specialty are bombs, I know the recipe for healing elixirs."

He picks up some vials with an initially white fluid swirling around in it before he adds some admixture to it and it turns red.

"Drink these quick. These don't last long." 

Scrit feeds 4 Elixirs of Life one by one to the hurt people.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-09 00:43:09):
*[image]* (been unlucky with my rolls lol)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-09 00:43:46):
(Maybe @TheTeberon can help?)

**Verge (#5) | Teberon** (2025-07-09 00:45:29):
(I can once I got I've had something to eat and drink)

**Verge (#5) | Teberon** (2025-07-09 00:51:55):
Verge watches the pangolin work—his movements deft, mechanical in their own way. The mixture of ingredients, the ratios, the practiced muttering. It calms something in him. Familiar ritual.

As Rubel explains, Verge listens—head tilted, expression unreadable. He doesn't interrupt. When the word tattoo is mentioned, his crimson eye flickers, then darts to Rubel’s body, scanning instinctively for matching marks.

When Scrit hands out the elixirs, Verge steps aside, letting the wounded take priority. He doesn’t need one—not yet.

“Seven Arches… rebel druids… Finara and Ritalson,” he repeats slowly, committing the names to memory. “Too many threads. But they connect somewhere.”

He glances toward the path ahead—then back to the corpses.

“I’ll assist your infiltration if needed,” he murmurs to Rubel. “Not stealth. Analysis.”

Then, to Scrit, a quiet aside as the last elixir is administered:

“They thought we were weapons. Let’s prove them right.”

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-09 00:54:31):
Scrit nods after having administered his Elixiers, at most he can offer right now. 
"Oh- Also you can call me Scrit."
He pauses for a moment, pondering. 
"I'll help as much as I can myself. I don't want to be trapped anymore."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-09 00:56:32):
@Askarans 

Who do you feed the elixirs to?

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-09 03:33:12):
Cyrus stands back from the others, keeping watch as the others heal and introduce themselves. It's too quiet for the alarm to have been sounded and the sounds of fighting and dying screams of their allies.

**Verge (#5) | Teberon** (2025-07-10 07:27:25):
Verge inclines his head slightly toward Scrit.

“Verge,” he offers simply. “I don’t remember giving the name. But it stuck.”

He turns away without further word and limps toward the battered chest near the straw bed—the one he didn’t look in when he first awoke. Part of him had been afraid to.

He kneels slowly, joints protesting, and pries it open.

Inside: a waterskin, still half full, and a tightly wrapped ration pack bearing faint markings from the Nexus Lab.

His lab.

The scent of it—processed grain, sterilized proteins, the faint alchemical tang of long-term preservatives—hits him like a pulse of memory. Not comfort. Control.

He sits on the ground beside the chest and unscrews the waterskin, taking slow, measured sips. Then he breaks the ration, chewing each bite with grim efficiency, not hunger.

As he eats, his eye doesn’t stop scanning—Scrit, Rubel, Cyrus, Illiani.

Their tattoos.

Their wounds.

Their purpose.

He swallows the last of the ration and tightens the cap on the skin.

Then, quietly to himself, but not quite under his breath:

“First the void… now a garden of dead men.”

He stands.

“Let’s see how deep this root system goes.”

**Eimer Hone** (2025-07-12 18:53:35):
“Let’s keep moving then.”

**Verge (#5) | Teberon** (2025-07-13 00:42:23):
Verge rises to his full height, the final sip of stale water sliding down his throat like a closing memory. He dusts the straw from his coat with methodical precision, then pulls a thin obsidian stylus from a hidden pocket and unrolls a stained vellum sheet from the inner lining of his coat.

In the center of the page: a rough, living sketch of the greenhouse.
On the side: names. Rubel. Scrit. Illiani. Cyrus. Bolan—underlined in crimson ink.

His crimson eye narrows as he stares at the name.

He draws a single vertical line beneath it, then murmurs low, but clear enough for nearby ears:

“Initiating lead protocol. Subject: Bolan.”

He circles the name once, then scribes two words above it:

THE ROOT OF MADNESS

He speaks aloud, as if recording into some invisible archive:

“Designation: Field Investigation 01.
Objective: Locate and assess the mental state of Bolan, former druid leader.
Status: Believed alive. Possibly compromised.
Lead hypothesis: Bolan holds answers regarding the tattoos, the temporal anomalies, and our missing time.”

Then, a piercing question written beneath the investigation’s title—etched in red:

“What shattered Bolan’s mind—and was it meant to shatter ours?”

He tucks the vellum away, eyes gleaming.

Then, sharply, to the group:

“Everything we see from here—ritual marks, altered flora, patterns in the rebels’ patrols—it all feeds this question. Every lie, every corpse, every broken vine may hold a piece.”

He steps past the bodies and into the path ahead.

“I’m following the cracks until I find the faultline.”

Pursue a Lead Activated
Target: Bolan
Investigation Name: The Root of Madness
Primary Question: What shattered Bolan’s mind—and was it meant to shatter ours?

**Verge (#5) | Teberon** (2025-07-15 06:18:08):
*[image]* Hey party just want to let you know that both of the doors are locked.

**Verge (#5) | Teberon** (2025-07-15 06:19:30):
What do you do next?

Aekold Black-Steel   @Nemesiux 
Rubel   @MrNegetZ 
Cyrus   @RyoYamakawa 
Anaiel Black-Steel   @HistoricallyInaccurate 
Scrit   @Askarans 
Illani   @ArtyArtillery

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-15 14:15:20):
Anyways let's go left first.
Rubel will use the mask and some of the druid's clothes (if they need cleaning i got prestidigitation) to disguise himself before entering the room carefully to scout it (trap finder btw).

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-16 09:24:42):
You enter the room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-16 09:24:52):
It's a fabric production room

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-16 09:24:56):
Looms, textiles, etc.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-16 09:25:01):
There's a door to the north.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-16 09:25:11):
Or a ladder leading UP the treehouse.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-16 09:26:39):
*[image]*

**Eimer Hone** (2025-07-17 09:11:15):
“Shall we go up the ladder? Maybe there will be something up there.” Anaiel steps forward.

**Verge (#5) | Teberon** (2025-07-19 02:44:28):
Verge lingers at the base of the ladder, running a hand along the grain of the loom. His fingers catch on threads—unfinished patterns, dyes half-set, torn fiber caught in tension. He tilts his head, taking in the layout. Not just cloth. Not just craft. Something made in a hurry. Or... interrupted.

He turns to the others.

“North is an exit. But this—” he nods toward the ladder, “this is personal. They live up there.”

As Rubel climbs, Verge steps aside, watching the fabric swaying from the motion—watching the shadows above.

He mutters, almost like thinking aloud to Scrit or Anaiel:

“People hide their beliefs on the ground floor… but they hide their sins where they sleep.”

His eye glows faintly.

“Let’s see what Bolan keeps in the attic.”

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 10:05:02):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 10:05:15):
You find yourself in a room of dual purpose.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 10:05:22):
A library and a laboratory.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 10:05:38):
A room of books, glass vessels, burners, and other distilling
equipment.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 10:06:02):
A dwarven Oak steward is here.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 10:06:35):
The dwarf is clearly an alchemist.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 10:06:50):
The shelves have much alchemical ingredients.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 10:06:52):
Including shiver.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 10:07:37):
The dwarf looks at you Rubel:
"What was all that noise from downstairs?
I am mid brewing, I couldn't leave my station."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 10:08:01):
There is a human sized purple and golden spider who is currently bitting into a web wrapped leshy.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 07:35:54):
@MrNegetZ

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 09:24:55):
The dwarf:
"Who are you?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 09:25:31):
Delphon:
"I'm Delphon, who are you?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 09:25:39):
Delphon:
"Good job stopping the attackers."

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-23 09:36:16):
"It's me Menelimus, don't you recognise the mask. Sorry no time to talk i'll go get more help, they got Rifon real good and managed to injure Hyacinth and Wisteria."
Rubel will climb back down in a hurry.
And tell/signal quietly to everyone else to hide around and wait to ambush the (maybe) coming druid.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-23 09:37:38):
(Do I recognise that alchemist in some capacity?)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 09:54:34):
Where are the party hiding?

**Verge (#5) | Teberon** (2025-07-23 10:17:43):
(we are going with that plan. No need to think to much)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-23 12:17:50):
Scrit hides against the bushery of the wall, using his leaf weave to sort of blend in.

**Verge (#5) | Teberon** (2025-07-23 12:27:24):
I guess verge will do the same as scrit except verge will be trying to use his shield as cover (aka defending)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 14:52:00):
Delphon, at the bottom of the ladder, looking around:
"Where now laddy?"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-23 17:07:14):
Cyrus did his best to try and hide his large frame.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:09:45):
You open the door, Delphon sees the group and..... COMBAT!!!!!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:11:10):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:12:29):
Cyrus wins the initiative with 22!

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-25 21:20:10):
Scrit, being prepared, goes into Rage as a free action. 
Then Scrit walks into position to get a better shot with the Bottled Lightning to throw in his rage onto Delphon, throwing it in such a way, that the splash remains focussed on Delphon.
At last, he draws an Acid Flask.

(The splash damage adds to it)

*[image]* Verge, Having seen this coming will instinctively Think of ways to take the druid (I'll use devise a stratagem as a free action and Recall knowledge as a free action because of known weakness. then I'll move 10 feet to the right throw a Dread ampoule and a skunk bomb at the druid) 
He skips over to a better position and throws 2 bottles at the druid

Oh I forgot to ask what question. What is the  druid's Normal AC?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-26 16:35:12):
He already was put off guard with @Askarans 's attack. I don't think the frightened 1 puts him at 11 AC or less..

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-26 16:35:19):
But i think you kill him bro...(if not then i'll go next)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-26 18:07:08):
He was already On less than half from the 7 damage i think...

(Poor guy getting blasted with Geneva violations)

**Verge (#5) | Teberon** (2025-07-26 21:55:53):
(Stinken druids)

Dead.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-27 18:12:38):
The spider comes down the ladder and attacks!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-27 18:14:53):
....with his master dead, the spider hesitates.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-27 18:15:04):
A nature check could be used to tame him.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-27 18:15:08):
Anyone want to attempt ?

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-27 18:17:26):
*[image]* Having been an animal himself, Scrit thinks he still has some connection to the wild nature. He gently approaches it with calm pangolin noises and a morsel.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-27 18:49:42):
(How big is the spider?)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-27 20:57:21):
"I'll call you Octo." Scrit says, offering it to climb onto him.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-29 09:39:21):
Afterwards, Scrit climbs up the ladder.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-29 11:05:54):
(Scrit is Medium as well)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-29 11:08:02):
(But I'd be fine having Scrit be Small, now that I think about it.)

**Verge (#5) | Teberon** (2025-07-29 19:33:20):
Verge will follow you up
