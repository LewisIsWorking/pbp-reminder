Path Wars:
You cross the stone bridge. 
The druidic guards do not prevent your passage, though eye your group wearily.

You pass by a few outer buildings, workshops, guard rooms, toilets,
and before the group is a large round stone corridor.

ANY magically attuned characters will feel primal magical essence here.
Anyone else simply feels a heaviness in the air, a great pressure on the mind and body.

Streaks of light pierce the walls from above through the vines and cracked stone.

The group walks through the dark corridors until they reach in inner court yard: the seven arches.

Despite the time of day, it is impossible dark during your walk in the corridor, with the green light piercing through.
Now you stand in what seems like midnight, your personal time pieces will tell you to be mid-afternoon, but the sky 
is dark.

Seven stone archways stand in a neat circle in this large space.
 
Each archway is 10 metres tall and over 5 metres feet wide.

Multicolored lights of unknown provenance warp and weave across the arches’ stone faces.

Surrounding the arches is a circle of dwarf oak trees, each tree towers over the group, stretching high into the sky,
well above the arches, as if feeding off their energy or reaching for something in the sky itself.

Each tree you estimate to be at least 50 metres tall but not exceeding much more than 3 metres in width.

A glowing hempen rope tied around the tree trunks forms a barricade.

In the middle of the circle of arches, a small podium clearly used for rituals sits about 3 metres tall.

The only light is provided by floating lanterns that hang in the air.
They seem to be made of wood with dancing lights inside them that look like dozens of hectic fireflies.

( AI art inconsistency, there are only 7 arches and it's a dark sky )

There are two large tree guardians in the room, they are watching the group but say nothing.

Anaiel steps forward great and looks up at the runes on the rope.

The runes are primal, not arcane.

Still, you are able to distinguish some features of the runes.

Upon these runes, you recognise a spell that all 4 traditions know: alarm.
 
A form of the alarm spell has been woven into the ropes.

It seems the rope draws power from the trees, following through the rope-like wiring.

"Oh so it's an alarm spell? From what i remember there is often a password that would let us pass without triggering it, or we could try and disable it but it's probably going to be harder".

Rubel is going to try and contact Finara through the seashell ring.
"Hey Finara you there? We somehow managed to get in thanks to our pretty faces and a nice pink haired gnome druid, we are currently deciding what to do with the alarm, would you know the password to the alarm spell or should we go back and ask them or just try and disable it?"
