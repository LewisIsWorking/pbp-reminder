**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-02 16:40:59):
Lemma Feldthorn says slowly:
"Well, well.
That's a good idea.

You all look trained, at least in the basics.

And you, white haired one, I can tell you've seen some proper combat in your time."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-02 16:47:08):
Lemma Feldthorn continues:
"Well, we are politically disabled to deal with this threat.
Bolan has gone beyond rebellion and must be talked down ... Or stopped more permanently.

The shadow-wither key is a powerful artefact that can manipulate ritual magic, but it is tricky.

The key has almost a mind of its own and has resisted identification by the oak stewards in all of our time owning it.

You can imagine why we can't be more public with this information, we would have all sorts trying to steal it, or worse: study it and discredit our order."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-02 16:47:46):
Lemma Feldthorn continues further:

"Here.
I'll give you 30 gold for completing this task.
15 now, then 15 when you come back."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-02 16:47:58):
Lemma Feldthorn hands you Rubel 15 gold pieces.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-02 16:50:33):
Lemma Feldthorn then says quite seriously:

"The Wilewood is a vast fey forest.
Entry is normally strictly forbidden for several reasons, except the gnome colonies, but it's not just to keep the forest and its softer inhabitants safe.
It is also to keep those who would walk the wood from meeting those that stalk the forest.

The walls of reality between the first world and the prime material plane are extremely thin in the woods.

Take extreme caution then further caution again."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-02 16:52:23):
Lemma Feldthorn then smiles and says:
"Right then.

It's a 3 day journey to the woods.

We will supply you with two horses and a cart tomorrow morning, it's almost night time which is far too late to be starting such a journey.

Are any of you proficient in driving a cart?

Tonight you can sleep in the dorms here and shop at the oak druid armoury if you need any equipment."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-04 07:58:56):
What happens next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-05 04:59:08):
What happens next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-05 20:37:25):
Lemma Feldthorn:
"Anything else?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-05 21:22:28):
@ArtyArtillery 
@RyoYamakawa 

You see the party talking to a hobbit druid with a horse.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-01-05 21:41:13):
As they approach Illiani waves shyly and comments aside to Cyrus.

"I wonder if they can sense us the way we can sense them?"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-01-05 22:36:21):
Cyrus chuckles and put his hand down on her shoulder.

"No need to be so shy. If these are meant to be our new companions we should greet them with vigor."

Grinning from ear to ear he hefts Illiani up as puts her on his shoulder holding her so she doesn't fall off. With his other arm he waves to the others.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-01-05 23:23:57):
Being picked up gives Illiani an initial startle, but once she realizes what's happening she calms down and doesn't struggle.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-06 02:39:48):
@MrNegetZ 
@HistoricallyInaccurate 
@Nemesiux

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-11 07:13:06):
Original party, Illini & Cyrus stand before you.

The halfling says:
"Greetings, more of your group I suppose?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-14 17:35:22):

@ArtyArtillery

(Current group)

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-01-14 22:31:48):
"Doctor Ritalson just brought us here a moment ago, but we haven't met anyone named Finara yet. But we are here to help! It's a pleasure to meet you all, I'm Illiani."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-01-14 23:45:10):
"And I'm Cyrus, Cyrus Wornhoof at present." The minotaur carefully and gently lifts Illiani from her perch on his shoulder and sets her down. Only after he rises back to his full height does he offer a polite nod to the group and extends his hand out to the one who greeted them.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-15 14:00:29):
What happens next? :)

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-01-15 19:35:15):
Cyrus gently shakes "hands" with Rubel and nods along as he gets us up to speed on current goings-on.

"I see, well I can't speak for my companion but I'm happy to provide assistance. I was still in training when I was taken, but I can handle myself well."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-01-15 22:52:25):
"I was lucky enough to fall asleep while on the road so travelling to a forest and back is not any problem at all. But for being trained with weapons, I don't think so. Lady Luck be praised most of my travels haven't been met with much violence, but I am certainly capable of it. However, all my training has taught me to rely on myself. I could try swinging a metal stick around, but..."

She shakes her head with distaste.

"It would probably be better to save the metal for someone who might use it better. Besides, I can't channel energy through a weapon other than my bow, and that's only possible because I spent a long time practicing with it."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-17 20:03:00):
What happens next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-17 20:04:49):
You are all aware that each of yous bear a magical scar-tattoo.

Though you will all be aware that Rubel's scar-tattoo has a somewhat different aura is slightly different.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-17 20:05:06):
@MrNegetZ 

Is Rubel's tattoo visible to the new players?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-17 20:05:26):
Also please post everyone's tokens for the new players.
:)

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-01-19 21:34:19):
"Which forest are we going to? I'm not from this place, but I've studied various cultures and realms surrounding the Sellen River."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-01-19 22:29:39):
"i must admit I may need some supplies. I was travelling light as my master and I had planned to stay at inns during most of our travel if possible. That and it is a little bit chillier than I am used to. I am not very well-versed in geography but I think we're quite a bit north of where I last was and most of my life I have lived between the Great Belt and the Tropic of the Kraken."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-22 08:07:13):
Lemma Feldthorn looks at you with a bewildered look:

"I have work to do.
Frankly you've taken enough of my time already."

Lemma Feldthorn whistles and a squirrel 🐿️ wearing a golden necklace.

Lemma Feldthorn:
"Follow him."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-22 08:07:28):
The squirrel 🐿️ scurries off out of the hall.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-01-22 17:10:23):
Cyrus just looks to Illiani and starts to follow the squirrel as well.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-01-22 19:31:19):
Illiani shrugs and follows after Cyrus and Rubel.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-22 19:35:12):
The squirrel leads the group through the winding corridors of the ancient druid castle, its tiny form darting ahead with unerring purpose. 

The castle is alive with the quiet hum of nature’s magic—vines creep along the stone walls, their leaves trembling as if whispering secrets of the past. 

Soft green light filters through high arched windows, casting shifting patterns of leaves and branches onto the moss covered floors.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-22 19:35:20):
Towering wooden doors, carved with intricate depictions of nature’s cycles, line the passageways. 

Some remain closed, their handles entwined with roots, while others stand ajar, revealing glimpses of overgrown chambers filled with relics of the long-forgotten era of elven supremacy.

The scent of damp earth and wildflowers lingers in the air, mingling with the faint rustle of unseen creatures moving just beyond sight.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-22 19:35:28):
Through narrow passageways lined with bioluminescent fungi and across bridges woven from living roots, the group follows. 

The architecture is a seamless blend of stone and nature, as though the castle was not built, but grown from the very land itself. Ethereal motes of light drift lazily through the air, illuminating murals of druids in communion with great beasts, their figures frozen in ancient reverence.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-22 19:35:37):
At last, the squirrel stops before an enormous set of double doors, their surface adorned with a sprawling relief of an ancient oak tree, its branches extending outward in intricate, interwoven patterns. A gentle pulse of green energy courses through the wood as the doors creak open, revealing the druidic armory within. The chamber beyond is bathed in a soft, emerald glow, the walls lined with armor crafted from bark, vines, and the scales of long-extinct beasts. Each piece hums with dormant power, infused with the essence of the natural world.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-22 19:35:39):
The stillness of the room is profound, the only sound the quiet rustling of leaves that seem to stir with anticipation.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-22 19:46:05):
*[image]* Stepping through the wall itself this being walks forth.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-22 19:46:21):
Not of the living, yet not purely a being of undeath.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-22 19:46:40):
A blue chirping bird 🐦 sits on his shoulder, singing a song.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-22 19:47:00):
The undead druid feeds it a berry that was growing on his ribs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-22 19:47:27):
The undead druid looks to you all and says:
"Hail visitors.

A couple birds told me you'd be coming down here."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-22 19:48:36):
Despite going several floods down the orbs of natural light make it feel like you are on the surface.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-01-25 06:23:40):
Cyrus steps forward to address the skeletal druid.

"Rubel here mentioned cold iron weapons before and I find myself a bit underprepared for the climate here compared to the tropics I am used to so could use some warmer garments and a blanket to pair with my bedroll.  Oh, and also not the most common request I'm sure. But I had misplaced my tools for caring for my hooves so I would like to acquire replacements or to be pointed to someone who could assist me with that."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-25 14:03:22):
All of this is at the standard prices and he will perform such transactions with you now.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-25 14:32:56):
The guy in the corner gives you a thumb up

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-01-25 14:39:15):
Rubel will sell:
2x alchemist googles
1x Alchemist tools
2x Studded leather armor
2x Kukris
This should net him 105 gold and 1 silver.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-01-25 14:48:14):
Rubel will pull out the animal staff he has and ask the party:
"Any nature casters here? I have a weird mosquito staff. If no one speaks up i'm selling it"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-01-25 16:52:08):
"Unfortunately I dabble in the occult myself." Cyrus looks around to the others to see if anyone else speaks up.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-01-25 18:59:20):
"I am in a similar position. The magic of nature and the ways it works has always been a little confusing to me."

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-01-25 19:10:37):
"Well then it's also getting sold"
Rubel will also sell the mosquito animal staff.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-25 23:09:02):
The blight druid said:
"Is that all?
Anything else to sell or buy?"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-01-30 01:07:04):
"I use my deity's preferred weapon, a Jiu Huan Dao. However, I am capable of using most weapons as I am aware that aside from some port cities it likely isn't seen let alone carried. As for supplies outside of what i requested I will need fresh rations for sure, maybe a new waterskin as well."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-30 05:35:22):
Anything further with the blight druid?
