So, you proceed up the stairs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 18:31:48):
Loot sent to stash.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 18:46:36):
You go up the wooden stairs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 18:46:55):
As you go up the stairs, the treehouse is clearly more primally magical.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 18:48:00):
What was before planks and processed materials is now wild vines and thick bushes forming the floor beneath your feet.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 18:50:54):
Along the walkway is an old woman.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 18:51:07):
She was sitting with what seems to be a pet spirit fox.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 18:51:18):
She was swinging her legs off the edge.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 18:51:25):
She stands now, slowly and unsteady.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 18:51:38):
She is old, but she is clearly a rebel druid too.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 18:53:11):
Jeraya:

"Ah. So you are the ones who set off the alarms.

My name is Jeraya."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 18:53:42):
Jeraya looks down at the spirit fox.

She was petting it a moment ago, it leapt into the air, disappeared and is now on the ground at Jeraya's feet.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 18:53:51):
Jeraya:
"This is Moss. My spirit fox."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 18:54:12):
Jeraya looks about you all:
"Anyone of you in touch with the spirit world?
Or...like foxes?"

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-11-14 19:06:08):
Axtra looks at the fox, her face uncontrollably forming a smile. "It's so cute!" She says kneeling to try to get her eyes level, wondering how it just disappeared and reappeared elsewhere. 

"I like most animals." She follows up, "This here is Kat." She points to the cat made of flames that is rubbing against her leg.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 19:18:30):
Jeraya:
"Well then, I suppose Moss will be yours."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 19:19:26):
Jeraya takes a step forward, whistles sharply and stabs Axtra in the face....

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 19:19:33):
COMBAT.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 19:19:51):
Jeraya:
"Bolan was a good boy, once...."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 19:20:48):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 19:21:22):
*[image]* Anaiel Black-Steel wins initiative with 26.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-11-14 20:07:43):
*[image]* Not appreciating the stab at her face, Axtra's body begins to burn hot. Fire forms around her, the heat so intense it almost feels like ice.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-11-14 20:09:12):
*[image]* She focuses the flames into her hands and strikes out at Jeraya, landing a solid blow.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-11-14 20:10:16):
*[image]* Her next attack carries less a more familiar heat.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 20:10:44):

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-11-14 20:13:32):
*[image]* She makes a strange clicking noise and Kat's fur emits a gentle warmth. Aekold Black-Steele feels it more strongly than the others, and it is invigorating. 
Axtra's flames almost feel like they carry a force behind the heat, shielding her slightly.

((Channel (Which gets a free attack) > Attack > Stoke the heart on Aekold (Familiar of Restored Spirit targets Axtra))

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 20:18:21):
She didn't get her surprise stab btw.
