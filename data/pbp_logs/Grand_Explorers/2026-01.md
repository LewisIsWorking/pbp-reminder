**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 07:47:20):
*[image]* Critical hit deck #5

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 07:47:36):
The shot hits her shoulder, killing her immediately.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 07:47:44):
The fox spirit comes to rest on her corpse.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 07:48:13):
Anaiel Black-Steel looks sad at the corpse, slowing lowering her rifle.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2026-01-09 07:17:47):
Illiani tears up and looks away.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-09 17:13:22):
Axtra lets out a heavy, staggered sigh. A tear rolls down her face before she relaxes her stance, the flames around her flicker and slowly die out. She walks up to the fox-like creature and kneels next to it.

"I'm sorry, Moss." She whispers. "We should go."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-09 21:52:37):
Axtra picks up the fox gently and gives it a few gentle pets. 

"It will be okay." She says softly. "So long as you live, so does she."

Axtra will then turn towards the group. "So, where to next?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-18 07:20:15):
The coast is clear.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-18 07:20:46):
There is not much left for the group to explore in the treehouse fortress.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-18 07:21:06):
There's are two buildings on this level.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-18 07:21:23):
A main central building to the south west ⬅️.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-18 07:21:42):
And what looks to be a water processing room to the North.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-18 07:22:53):
The central building has a large set of reinforced wooden doors. 

A series of pipes go into these doors. 

If anyone would like to analyse these doors you can. 

The doors are otherwise locked & sealed to the outside world.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-18 07:23:15):
The single door to the water management room looks unlocked.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-20 19:49:52):
Axtra looks at the sealed doors, then at the group. "Well, I could try to burn my way through, but with us being in a treehouse, I find that ill-advised." She then looks towards the northern doors. "Think we can find a way in from there?"

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2026-01-20 21:14:47):
"A less direct approach does seem more likely to succeed. Hopefully, with fewer casualties than a forced entry through the main entrance."

Illiani frowns at the central building in thought.

"Korimona mentioned the enclave had fire protections, anyway. It's probably what those pipes are for."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 14:33:43):
What next?

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-26 16:50:12):
We (at least Axtra does) will approach the non-locked northern doors of the water management room and open them, carefully if possible.
