**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-05-01 19:17:01):
Rubel will break the cage, grab the animal(or cage if it's still inside) and book it to behind the staircase pillar.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-05-13 04:36:05):
What's Scrit's situation right now? Am I still restrained?

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-05-13 13:53:58):
Being still restrained and carried(?), Scrit can't do anything. SKIP

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-13 14:18:27):
You don't have the capacity to pick up Scrit.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-05-13 14:55:13):
(Medium)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-05-13 14:56:53):
So I can pick him up but I would be encumbered(but still have enough speed to make it to my spot and lay him down.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-15 20:07:00):
Ok so Rubel has taken his turn ?
