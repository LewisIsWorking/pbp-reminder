## Week 9 (Feb 23–Mar 01)

### 📅 Sunday, Mar 01

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:00:01):
The room is not actually a broom closet!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:00:18):
There are big pods and liquid drained onto the floor.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:00:35):
@LavenderCatbat I think is still wearing their strange outfit.

**Cannon McMahon** (2026-03-01 00:53:17):
Illiani pokes their head back into the room.

"No one outside yet, -oh!"

She nervously stands ready by the door with her shortbow.

**Ryo Yamakawa** (2026-03-01 01:03:45):
Cyrus peeks inside the apparently not-so closety closet. "So that's how they had a couple of others like us here like they did. Might need a word with the good doctor later about that."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:28:53):
Anaiel Black-Steel readies her gun.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:29:07):
What next? :)

**Lavender Le'Feygh** (2026-03-01 19:33:23):
Iris is shape changed into a purple fox with butterfly wings and sparks of green, red and far whimsy. She looks out at the other people as she looks over the others.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 21:08:53):
Anaiel Black-Steel:

"Uh. Hello?"

**King** (2026-03-01 22:47:33):
Caspian looks surprised, and pulls out his warhammer when he sees the readied weapons of the group in front of him. "Hello to you, as well. I don't suppose you folks were the ones who stuck us in the pods, were you?" he asked, clearly wary of the newcomers but not quite hostile. "If so, we'd both be quite interested in knowing why. And, of course, where exactly we are."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 22:48:14):
As you look upon these people, you sense something.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 22:48:42):
Your soul is sealed Caspian, there is a great power that leans over you.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 22:48:48):
All of the people in front of you are bound too.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 22:48:56):
And that Caspian is when you notice it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 22:49:46):
Somewhere on your body (your choice where!) is a whale tattoo with a phoenix in it's centre.

It glows slightly and as it does all of the people in front of you ALSO have whale tattoos but theirs all have other different mythical beings.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 22:50:02):
@LavenderCatbat and of course you too have a whale tattoo with a wraith in the middle.

**Laetheron** (2026-03-01 22:57:18):
Twilight raises a stubby wooden hand and waves, "Hi, there! There's been lots of people waking up in the treehouse recently. It's a bit weird isn't it?"
