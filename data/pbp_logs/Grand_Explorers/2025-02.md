**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-08 20:12:40):

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-02-10 06:38:05):

So i have 45gp left

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-02-10 06:38:47):
Rubell will also get: 2x 4 person tents (10gp)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-02-10 06:39:00):
A signal whistle : 8 copper

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-02-10 06:39:07):
4 stacks of rations :  1.6gp

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-02-10 06:41:45):
6 waterskins (6 x 5cp = 3sp)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-02-10 07:04:57):
Total for adventuring equipement (after weapons): 12gp 3 silver.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-02-10 07:09:01):
I had 181gp 30sp and 17cp (total of 184gp 1sp and 7cp= 184,17)
I bought for a total of 136gp + 12gp + 3sp = 148gp 3sp = 148,3

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-02-10 07:27:39):
Ok 1 more thing: A composite shortbow: 14gp
I now have 21,87 left

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-02-10 07:27:46):
An "acceptable" ammount

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-02-10 07:32:40):
"Well then we should be set to go so let's get to the dorms and rest for tomorrow's journey."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-02-10 09:29:01):
"And I was expecting to sleep on the road! It has been a while since I've slept in a building. Do you know if they have baths?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-10 18:31:43):
Otherwise, the rest of the group will go to a long room filled with bunk beds.

Several animals sleep in beds: squirrels, rats, birds, cats, foxes, ferrets, hedgehogs, etc.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-02-11 03:12:51):
If they let her, Illiani will definitely sleep in the baths. It's rare for places to have amenities for amphibians.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-14 00:04:16):
The next day you have breakfast and set off unless anyone has anything else they wish to do?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-17 12:03:26):
You set off.

The following 3 days pass as you set off across the River kingdoms.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-17 12:03:41):
Is anyone doing anything as you travel along the roads to the forest?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-17 12:08:09):
Do you enter the woods?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-17 12:08:24):
And who is trained in survival?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-17 12:09:06):
( Also, very close to level 2 milestone )

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-02-17 15:46:06):
I'm +4 and trained

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-02-17 20:50:30):
If we need to sense direction or navigate I've got a compass anyone can use.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-02-17 21:00:21):
Will the cart and everything go into the woods alright?

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-02-18 05:16:50):
"Should we... take the horses in and leave the cart? If this forest is dangerous we probably shouldn't leave the poor things alone here for long."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-02-18 20:54:10):
"I suppose if they are in danger outside of the woods they can just bolt."

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-02-20 08:37:27):
Illiani will cast light cantrips for whomever needs it while we're in the woods if it gets dark enough.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-02-20 20:44:19):
Cyrus will load up as much of the supplies as he has space for between his bag and any pouches he can secure to his side.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-22 22:29:02):
It is morning time.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-22 22:37:08):
There is a massive circular clearing.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-22 22:42:34):
The clearing has tall wavey grass that sways in the gentle breeze.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-22 22:42:39):
Along the clearing are:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-22 22:42:44):
SEVEN ARCHES!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-22 22:43:17):
One arch seems to be a primary arch, is much taller and wider.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-02-23 09:39:26):
Illiani would like to investigate the area. In particular she's interested in whatever history she can learn from the arches or recall from former studies.

**Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW** (2025-02-23 09:46:13):
Specific questions she has are who made these, why, and when.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-02-24 16:39:54):
Cyrus glances at the rest of the group before starting to follow Illiani, staying back a little bit but close enough to jump in if something dangerous starts to happen.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-26 04:35:26):
The waist-high grass of the forest clearing stands motionless in the still, serene air, creating an unbroken field of vibrant green that fills the space of the clearing.

 The seven stone arches stand in an inner circle at the center of the larger clearing. 

The arches are ancient structures, clearly of elven architecture with their flowing lines and intricate carvings.

The archs seem to beckon you forward with silent dignity, their arrangement forming a perfect smaller circle within the natural boundary of the forest edge.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-26 04:35:36):
As you both approach the ceremonial formation of arches, the tall waist-high grass parts with each step, crunching under foot.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-26 04:36:19):
Without warning, the grass to your left shudders despite the complete absence of wind. The disturbance is subtle—perhaps nothing more than a ground animal startled by your approach.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-26 04:36:26):
Illiani your vision darkens suddenly, the world seems to darken suddenly.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-26 04:36:35):
Two shadowy forms erupt from the concealing grass with terrifying silence. Wolf-like quadrupeds shrouded in shifting darkness that obscures their detailed form, each over 2 meters long and weighing around over 200 kilograms!

Their hollow eyes are the only distinct feature—perfect voids of magical shadow that reflect no light, absorb all hope.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-26 04:36:36):
The creatures leap toward Illiani, their shadowy forms coiling like springs before launching through the air, jaws opening to reveal nothing but deeper darkness within...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-26 04:39:29):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-26 04:39:43):
COMBAT!

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-02-26 04:47:46):
"I don't think these dogs will be as friendly as daisy here..."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-28 09:05:32):
I will be starting/setting up combat on Foundry at some point today.
