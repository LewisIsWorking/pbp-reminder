**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-16 11:39:32):
*[image]* Add 1 to the damage because I forgot to actually apply the courageous anthem damage. And because of my bard muse anthem will last 1 round beyond the current.

Added the anthem.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-16 12:05:16):
@RyoYamakawa Rerolling your damage.

Jeraya falls back, spluttering blood.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-16 12:06:42):
Jeraya:
"I...I....."

Jeraya swings with the dagger, slashing the air.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-16 12:07:07):
The deep gashes into her body making her movement stiff and slow.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-16 17:07:32):
"It's not too late to give up." Axtra attempts to appeal to Jeraya, "Think of those who you will leave behind."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-16 18:02:46):
Jeraya:
"Strike me down, or..." 

Jeraya falls to 1 knee:
"Or I shall call upon the power of the trees to.... St... Stop you all."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-16 18:12:28):
The memory of Emberlight's final moment crosses Axtra's mind. Her determination to protect Axtra from their cruel master written on her face before being struck down looks very much the same as Jeraya's. 

For a moment, Axtra's chest tightens as it becomes harder to breath, she lets out a choked reply before readying herself to end the fight before them. "He's going to miss you."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-16 19:38:20):
The fox spirit (coming up in initiative!) looks ready to attack and defend his master!
