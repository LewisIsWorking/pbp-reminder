**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 11:53:49):
You are all aboard your spaceship.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 11:54:01):
When an alert pops up on screen.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 11:54:11):
You are MEANT to be making your way planetside.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 11:57:42):
To the planet of Aballon.

To have dinner at a bar with your boss: Professor Tier-99.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 11:57:55):
The yellow alert triangle continues to BEEP.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 11:57:56):
BEEP.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 11:57:57):
BEEP.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 11:57:59):
BEEP.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 11:58:09):
Anyone going to click the display screen?

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2026-01-16 12:56:50):
Arctus glances up from where they're tinkering with some machinery nearby and drifts over to the screen.

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2026-01-16 12:58:37):
They raise a limb and press the screen.

**Aiden101 | Eliora Elf Riddleport** (2026-01-16 14:59:46):
Damon approaches the screen, curious on what that could be.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-01-16 15:54:47):
Holis jerks his head up from where he fell asleep and coveras his ears with 2 of his hands.  "Comeon just another 30 minutes."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 21:39:44):
The speakers continue to BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 21:39:49):
Waiting for touch input.

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2026-01-16 23:37:50):
Arctus messes with the screen with rushed movements, trying to discern what triggered the alert

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 23:40:30):
The ship's protections are active and working well.

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2026-01-16 23:41:46):
"Oh dear, oh dear."

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2026-01-16 23:42:24):
"The risks seems minimal, is there any course of action anyone cares to pursue?," they say looking around the cabin

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-17 00:17:52):
The ship shakes from a laser cannon blast.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-17 00:18:00):
The screen says:
"0 damage received."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-17 19:12:46):
The ship lightly shakes.

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2026-01-18 02:42:55):
"I don't suppose these pirates are ones for diplomacy?" They say with a sardonic tilt of the head.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-01-18 03:53:46):
Grumbling as he sits up one hand scratching his head, one his belly and 2 stretched outward as he yawns.  "Perhaps someone could open a channel and tell them to piss off?"

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2026-01-20 15:16:00):
"I suppose this hypothesis is worth testing." Arctus fiddles with the comms system trying to hail the attacking pirates.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-20 16:08:26):
The scream.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-20 16:08:53):
It is indescribable. 

All of you hear something different.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-20 16:09:00):
You do not fare well.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-20 16:09:03):
You all pass out.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-20 16:09:11):
... 1 week later ...

**Aiden101 | Eliora Elf Riddleport** (2026-01-21 02:32:51):
After being knocked out by... Whatever that was, Damon starts to regain his senses, his head in utter chaos as he attemps to discern where he is.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-01-21 16:31:03):
Holis jerks up his arms flailing as he knocks his vr visor onto the floor.  "I'm up!  I'm up!  You didn't have to scream at me."  Looking quickly around and seeing everyone else in a state of regaining consciousness "Uhm.  I thought that ship couldn't hurt us."  He pats himself.  "Did they plunder us are we missing organs?"  He hops out of his seat and starts looking over the ship for missing items.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-21 16:37:11):
You all wake up, together in the brig.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-21 16:38:10):
You are all restrained.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-21 16:38:20):
The restraints require a keycard to open.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-21 16:38:31):
Opening them otherwise is impossible.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-21 16:41:00):
Joo-Dee stirs at the words 'missing organs', first slowly, then snaps awake in fear. She finds herself restrained, but her primary focus lies in her prosthetics. Did they remove any of her limbs? What of her eye?

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-21 17:21:38):
Joo-Dee looks mildly distraught at her missing arm and leg, though she is not surprised. She is, however, glad they did not risk extreme harm by trying to take her eye. 

She looks about the brig and sees the rest of the crew in similar situations. "What happened?" She asks, "I felt the ship shake from some sort of an attack, then some sort of high-frequency signal must have incapacitated me shortly after."

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-01-21 19:06:04):
Holis struggles within the seat. "I don't like this game. I want off this ride."  He attempts to manifest his hologram and fails.

**Aiden101 | Eliora Elf Riddleport** (2026-01-21 20:02:03):
Damon sighs in relief seeing his mostly organic body is intact, but still struggles off his restraints, mostly in anger. "Well, whatever the heck happened that knocked us out, it worked, alright. Damn bastards..."

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2026-01-21 22:07:26):
Arctus lets out a grumble as they awaken, then after a brief check up on the situation, "I will be very displeased if they broke any of my tools."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:36:00):
BOOOOOOOM!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:36:19):
A portal opens: half green flame, half blue flame.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:36:26):
The green flickers out: it lost.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:36:36):
Out of the portal comes something odd.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:36:48):
The corpse of a cat-man.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:37:00):
Flesh is charred.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:37:41):
Half of the body has no flesh, just bone and some clinging organs, popping and frying.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:37:47):
The corpse is COOKING in front of you all.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:38:49):
The other half of the body is odd.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:39:04):
The cat-man's body has become red slime, half transformed, half formed.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:39:31):
The corpse twitches for a moment.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-01-26 13:42:59):
Holis stops struggling for a half second.  "Welp!  I do not think they will be helping us."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:43:37):
The twitching continues but this creature is clearly dead.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:44:35):
The sound of a distant alarm is heard. 

You recognise the alarm to be the brig's sensors.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 13:44:50):
Which means whatever just happened has been alerted to the pirates.

**Aiden101 | Eliora Elf Riddleport** (2026-01-26 15:47:06):
Damon watches the situation unfold horrified.

"What the hell is going on..." He mutters as he stops his struggling, focused on the portal and the twitching corpse that came out of it.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-26 16:46:28):
"What in Weydan's travels just happened!?" Joo-Dee exclaims as she shunts herself into the closest corner away from the inexplicable horror that just popped in from nowhere.

**StorybookRhizome | #5 Laetheron | 09: Arctus** (2026-01-26 18:08:42):
Arctus perks up, "A rather curious phenomenon. I wonder by what mechanism the partial teansmutation occured... If only I still had access to my lab."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-27 22:50:01):
The door slides up, revealing an automaton cleaner.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-27 22:51:53):
Joo-Dee looks at the open door and then back to the others before attempting to scoot herself through. "Now's our... chance!" she exclaims between scoots.
