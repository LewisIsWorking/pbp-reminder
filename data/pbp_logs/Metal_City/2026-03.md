Dekker died from the first hit from @Aiiden101

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:41:40):
^ This

**Laetheron** (2026-03-01 01:41:50):
lmaooo

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:41:59):
Your other barrage of attacks hit him before he hit the floor, already dead.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:42:06):
The corpse gets pretty torn up.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:29:31):
Oofy:

"Wow... that was... violent."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:29:41):
Oofy starts cleaning up the splattering remains.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:41:09):
What next? :)

**Laetheron** (2026-03-01 03:35:47):
Arctus drifts over to the body and examines the pirate's comms unit. 

Can I try to get a rough approximation of how many pirates there are? I have a hacking tool kit if that matters.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 03:40:40):
Sure, you think it's less than 10.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 04:08:10):
Oofy:
"I do like cleaning, but on my own terms."

**Aiden101** (2026-03-01 15:32:31):
Damon smiles at himself upon seeing the clean shot that went through the pirate. "Looks like i've still got it. Though uh, was beating the body even more needed? Not that it matters in the end." He says as he reloads his rifle, soon turning to Oofy. "And thanks a lot for what you did for us."

**Bruce** (2026-03-01 16:26:24):
Chua looks around and pauses.  "Well we could not be sure the first shots were enough.  Some of these pirates are old and grizzled and can survive an arm and leg being obliterated.  So.  Just consider this was a few extra hands of help.  We need to all six this for our own safety."
