**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:41:35):
Dekker died from the first hit from @Aiiden101

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:41:40):
^ This

**Laetheron** (2026-03-01 01:41:50):
lmaooo

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:41:59):
Your other barrage of attacks hit him before he hit the floor, already dead.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 01:42:06):
The corpse gets pretty torn up.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:29:31):
Oofy:

"Wow... that was... violent."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:29:41):
Oofy starts cleaning up the splattering remains.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 02:41:09):
What next? :)

**Laetheron** (2026-03-01 03:35:47):
Arctus drifts over to the body and examines the pirate's comms unit. 

Can I try to get a rough approximation of how many pirates there are? I have a hacking tool kit if that matters.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 03:40:40):
Sure, you think it's less than 10.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 04:08:10):
Oofy:
"I do like cleaning, but on my own terms."

**Aiden101** (2026-03-01 15:32:31):
Damon smiles at himself upon seeing the clean shot that went through the pirate. "Looks like i've still got it. Though uh, was beating the body even more needed? Not that it matters in the end." He says as he reloads his rifle, soon turning to Oofy. "And thanks a lot for what you did for us."

**Bruce** (2026-03-01 16:26:24):
Chua looks around and pauses.  "Well we could not be sure the first shots were enough.  Some of these pirates are old and grizzled and can survive an arm and leg being obliterated.  So.  Just consider this was a few extra hands of help.  We need to all six this for our own safety."

**Laetheron** (2026-03-01 18:32:40):
Since the immediate danger is over, Arctus hovers over to the slimed specimen to conduct a hasty analysis. Those near them might hear faint psychic musings on the body's condition as they move past.

With a lifted arm, a faint wire mesh scans over the body, feeding information to a holographic screen that appears in front of Arctus. [Casts Analyze Target]

"Now for the interesting part..."

**Laetheron** (2026-03-01 18:36:10):
Arctus perks up as if remembering something and turns towards the party, "Ah, before I forget, there seems to be approximately ten pirates remaining on board. Do with that information what you will."

And they unhurriedly resume their morbid activity.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 21:10:55):
Oofy looks at you:
"I... Well... 
You're welcome but you understand that this is only step 1.
There's no going back now. 

You need to kill every single member of the pirate crew on this vessel or they will know I helped you and I will be tortured and sold into slavery or scrap."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 21:11:47):
Oofy:
"I'd rather 6 Vs 1 instead of 10 Vs 6..."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 21:12:13):
Ok cool, what does that do? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 21:18:54):
Oofy:
"Very good point.

As you know each room on this ship is numbered. 

We are at the furthest mid point of the ship and thus this is room 1.

Beyond this room is the recreational room, room 2.

There are 8 rooms on this level. 

And 5 rooms on the upper level." 

Oofy says shyly:

"I already studied the schematics. 

This is a most-wonderful ship. 

My crew don't appear to realise the underlying complexity of the technologies and engineering that lay within these walls."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 21:22:40):
Oofy:
"We may have another 12 rooms to go but many won't be occupied unless something strange happens as most of the crew is not actually on this ship. 

They remain on the split blade with "Darling” Dalyx. 

Dalyx is Captain Firestorm's second in command.

I think Captain Firestorm is likely to take over this ship as her primary vessel and use it to start a fleet."

**Laetheron** (2026-03-01 21:32:35):
You focus on the target, gathering data as magical holograms display information. When the casting is complete, you learn biometric information about the target, including its fingerprints, medical conditions, and other basic physiological information.
 
You or anyone you advise about 
the analysis gains a +1 status bonus to checks to Impersonate the creature, to Treat Wounds on the creature, and to Recall Knowledge about it. 

If the target is illusory or under the effects of illusion magic, you detect this only if the effect's rank is lower than the rank of your analyze target spell.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 21:53:59):
Okie dokie. 

What are you trying to discover?

**Laetheron** (2026-03-01 22:31:35):
Its composition, what exactly the body was turning into, how the gooification works, anything along those lines.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 22:31:55):
Do you need to roll ?

**Laetheron** (2026-03-01 22:34:26):
I could do a recall knowledge if you think that works

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 22:39:49):
You focus your magics on analysing the goopy corpse remains.

As your magic injects itself into the corpse your mind is filled with facts and imagery.

You learn & confirm the following:

- The cat-man is a Pahtra.
- Male.
- Cause of death: simultaneous dimensional shearing and polymorphic transmutation.
- Two competing forces destroyed this body at the same time.
- The body is still faintly warm despite being dead for some time.
- That warmth is not biological.
- For the deeper analysis, roll Crafting or Occultism.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 22:40:18):
When I say: "- Two competing forces destroyed this body at the same time."

I mean as in they were playing a sort of tug of war and it ended badly.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 22:47:37):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 22:47:52):
You got a 22 on your crafting check to analyse the goop corpse.
