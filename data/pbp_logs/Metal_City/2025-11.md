But I wanted to be a bounty hunter

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-11-14 19:49:42):
How many bounties are on this ship?

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-11-14 20:48:29):
I'm guessing they are wondering if any of the crew have bounties on them maybe.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2025-11-14 21:06:28):
Doing bounties is just one way of.making money.  We can also be space pirates.
