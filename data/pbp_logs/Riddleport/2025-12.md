**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-12-02 05:47:32):
Games paused, don’t see anything on the map either

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-02 05:48:00):
There is an unpause macro for the first part at least.

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-12-02 05:48:29):
Oh, unpausing the game is enabled for players?

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-02 05:50:03):
Yep

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-12-02 05:56:03):
Is it not space bar? Cause space bar isn’t working 😭

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-02 05:57:21):
No, there is a macro.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-02 05:59:15):

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-12-02 05:59:27):
Yeah, I don’t have that

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-02 06:00:04):
Odd, ok. I'll unpause it. Maybe the GM has to enable it for each player and he missed you...

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-12-02 06:00:32):
*[image]* Yeah, you have some kind of perms that I don’t I guess

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-12-02 06:00:50):
(I don’t even have a token on this map, that’s why I can’t see shit 😭)

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-02 06:01:44):
Are you on Riddleport Warehouse (Night) by any chance?

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-02 06:02:14):
If so you need to change the map with the pulldown menu to the upper left to Riddleport Warehouse.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-02 06:12:10):
No biggie. I loaded in on the same map which is why I even considered checking with you about it.

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-12-02 06:53:20):
Games still paused tho 🥀

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-02 06:54:42):
@PathWars Does the unpause macro only work per person using it?

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-02 07:13:24):
Odd

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-12-02 07:18:28):
Oh, we good

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-03 08:14:18):
Lenma Moonshine's turn. Round 3.

Lenma Moonshine has a speed of 30 feet.
Starting position: 77.5 ft (12.5 ft up the final staircase).
3 x strides.
Lenma sprints down the stairs, trying to catch up with her allies.
With Speed 30 ft and 3 Strides (90 ft total), and going down not being difficult terrain:
12.5 ft down final stairs + 15 ft across Kreun's room + 62.5 ft down main spiral = 90 ft.
End of turn: Lenma is 2.5 ft from the 1st floor hallway entrance, at the very bottom of the spiral staircase.

@Askarans 

Please try to answer in the next couple of days or we will auto move you down the stairs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-07 06:49:53):
Actually, if that's all your turns are going to be, shall we just do that now?

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-12-07 08:10:55):
Yeah

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 08:33:53):
END OF ROUND 3 // PARTY SIDE.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 08:37:33):
Beltias Kreun's turn.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 08:37:35):
Action 1: Escape.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 08:37:44):
The macro used his unarmed attack stat.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 08:37:48):
He got a 16.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 08:37:55):
It would be an 18 but -2 from prone.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 08:37:57):
DC 17.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 08:38:01):
FAILED BY 1!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 08:38:09):
Action 2: Escape, again.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 08:38:15):
Does it take MAP?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 09:01:29):
It does take map.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 09:01:34):
Acrobatics -4.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 09:01:38):
31 without map.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 09:01:42):
-4 is 27.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 09:01:48):
Critical success.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 09:02:27):
Beltias Kreun is going to move 5 feet further away with the critical success bonus effect.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 09:02:53):
He can't stride because he is prone.

Beltias Kreun will stand (action 3).

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 09:03:15):
END OF ROUND 3.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 09:03:18):
Start of Round 4.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 10:22:39):
ROUND 4

Sinhow
Sinhow is closest to the window and moves first. He crosses the remaining distance of the hallway in a few quick strides, then without hesitation launches himself at the glass.
The window explodes outward in a shower of glittering shards. Sinhow twists mid-air, shielding his face, and most of the glass skitters harmlessly off his armour. Then the ground rushes up to meet him.
He hits hard, the impact driving through his legs and sending him tumbling across the cobblestones. For a moment he lies there, breath knocked out of him, before forcing himself back to his feet. Blood trickles from a few shallow cuts, but he's up. He's close to Kreun now.
(12 damage taken: 2 slashing + 10 bludgeoning)

Cardigan
Cardigan is right behind Sinhow, racing down the hallway as glass rains down ahead of her. She doesn't slow — can't slow — and throws herself through the now-empty window frame.
The fall is brutal. She lands badly, cobblestones biting into her palms and knees, the shock of impact rattling her teeth. But she pushes herself upright, arcane energy already crackling at her fingertips, eyes searching for their quarry.
(10 bludgeoning damage taken)

Lenma Moonshine
The winter catfolk moves through the hallway with silent precision, her padded feet barely making a sound against the floorboards. She reaches the window just as Cardigan rises from her landing.
Lenma kicks off the sill and drops.
Unlike the others, she lands with preternatural grace — twisting in mid-air, limbs splaying to catch the wind, touching down on all fours like the cat she resembles. The impact barely registers. She rises smoothly, completely unruffled, and in the same fluid motion closes the distance to Kreun.
Her first strike catches him solidly — fist wreathed in crackling force energy that detonates on impact. Kreun staggers, clearly hurt, but shakes off the worst of it. Her follow-up swing whistles past his head as he jerks back at the last second.
(2 bludgeoning damage taken. Dealt 15 damage to Kreun.)

Necrila
Necrila bursts from the stairwell and charges down the hallway without slowing. The broken window ahead frames the evening sky and a twenty-foot drop to the courtyard. She doesn't hesitate — armour and all, the champion throws herself through the shattered frame.
The fall is short and punishing. She hits the cobblestones hard, the impact ringing through her bones, and crumples into a roll.
But Necrila is made of sterner stuff. She pushes through the pain, forcing herself back to her feet and drawing her weapon in one fluid motion. Her eyes find Kreun immediately.
(10 bludgeoning damage taken)

Yaseitori
Yaseitori is further behind, still descending the spiral when the others make their jumps. He pushes himself harder, taking stairs two at a time, then sprints down the hallway toward the broken window.
He leaps without stopping to judge the distance.
The landing goes poorly. Yaseitori hits the ground at an awkward angle, the impact driving the breath from his lungs and sending him sprawling face-first into the dirt. He lies there for a moment, groaning, the world spinning above him.
(10 bludgeoning damage taken. Prone.)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-09 10:29:31):
Hit Points.

Lenma. 2 damage, absorbed by Cat Nap's temporary hit points. UNHARMED.

Sinhow. 12 damage. HP: 32 - 12 = 20. INJURED.

Cardigan. 10 damage. HP: 32 - 10 = 22. INJURED.

Necrila. 10 damage. HP: 34 - 10 = 24. INJURED. 

Yaseitori. 10 damage. HP 28 - 10 = 18. INJURED.

...and Beltias Kreun: BADLY INJURED.

Beltias Kreun surrenders.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-13 17:18:08):
He is heavily wounded.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-13 17:18:17):
Beltias falls to his knees.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-13 17:19:53):
Beltias Kreun breathes deeply, blood drips from his wounds. 

His breath forms small clouds of mist, in this cold afternoon.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-13 17:20:45):
Beltias Kreun, still breathing deeply splutters out:
"Whoever paid you lot. 

I can double it. 

Spare me."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-12-13 17:22:45):
Sinhow speaks, breathy and shallow 
"After making me run all of those steps, TWICE. There is only one thing that can save you from her teeth" and he points to Necrilla. 
"Is telling us *everything* you know about old pidge."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-12-13 17:25:15):
Sinhow taps his foot, lowers his rapier and looks to Necrilla. 
"I wouldn't dally, she's getting antsy after all those steps. Everything means everything."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-12-13 17:36:31):
Sinhow laughs in the middle of his heavy breathing, and brings his rapier back up to Kreun's neck. 
"Make no mistake buddy boy, we are not here for you. You're just the first paving stone in our road, and you've been stepped on like every other obstacle we encounter along our path will be." Another deep breathe. 

"Pidge did some weird fuckin' shit, and I wanna know more about it before I feed Nercilla. But if you can't tell me anymore" Sinhow shrugs. 

"Feast away Necrilla, dinner is ready."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-13 17:44:46):
Beltias Kreun:
"There's been... Rumours about him but.... I've never paid them much attention. Bunch of crap."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-12-13 17:49:38):
Sinhow takes a deep breathe, and with an exaggerated exasperated motion looks around to the whole group. 
"Am I speaking fucking dwarvish? Is there some other meaning of the word "everything" that I'm not aware of? I wanna know how many fucking pimples that old fuck has on his ass. If you know something. SPEAK, because if I'm not satisifed by the time you're done talking, Nercilla eats."

Necrilla shows him her cloak which has all the heads of his friends

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-12-13 18:47:47):
Her cloak looks something like this, but it only has the heads of the crime boss friends

Beltias Kreun breaks down.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-15 16:46:52):
@MrNegetZ 

You sense an energy coming from Beltias Kreun. 

Some small fragmented arcane script appears on the back of your hands.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-15 20:50:33):
I'll aid him in figuring it out.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-15 22:43:47):
Beltais looks up at you:
"You....you're a cypher mage?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-17 01:21:49):
Anyone trained in medicine will know that Beltias (without healing) will die within a few hours.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-17 17:58:21):
Rax slips his way between Necrila and Kreun. "Now, now we have more use for him yet. And there are things far worse than death, even being eaten alive. I may wish to teach him some of those fates depending on his answers to my questions."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-17 19:32:34):
Mad Rat comes jogging over to the group.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-17 19:34:02):
Mad Rat looks at the group, looks at Beltias and grins a wide big smile. 

You see the gaps of teeth replaced with gold fake teeth.

Mad Rat's rainbow dyed hair settles past his shoulders:

"Well well. 

We did it. 

Now I gotta say, THAT went well. 

Not a single one of us are dead."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-18 22:40:18):
Rax watches him empty out everything, keeping a careful eye to see if he tries to skip over anything.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-23 02:15:31):
"Ok, now I'll examine you to see what injuries are most serious. Though I would guess the painful landing you had will be high on that list." Rax pulls out his Healer's Toolkit and starts moving slowly around him. "I would advise not making any sudden moves. While I want you alive most of them aren't so interested in such things."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-23 03:28:01):
"Ok, your choice now. You have some injuries that I can't treat without having more access than clothing, armor, and such allows. Fractured and broken bones from your fall just to name a couple. So, you either strip here or I patch you up enough so you don't die in just a couple of hours max. Then we can get you somewhere private for the rest. I'm not you, but I wouldn't want to strip in public as it is, but definitely not around here."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-23 04:28:34):
Cardigan looks uncomfortable.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-23 04:53:11):
Rax notes their reactions with an amused look, hidden away by his mask. He takes care to measure his voice before he speaks next. "I do have somewhere else we could go. A shop and a home as part of a tenement building in the Leeward District." He's curious if the gang boss will draw a connection or not from his words.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-26 21:44:41):
Beltias Kreun looks at Rax (@RyoYamakawa):
"....hmm. You run with a gang in the Leeward district?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-26 21:46:44):
Mad Rat:
"I'm gonna take Beltias, if that's ok.

Crime Lord Avery Slyeg is not gonna want to be waiting for very much longer..."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-27 02:33:05):
Rax  glances over to Mad Rat for a moment before focusing back on Beltias. "Of course. I'll get him patched up enough to make sure he's alive for him then."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-27 04:39:57):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-27 05:41:35):
I'll apply that healing now.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-27 05:43:44):
Rax pulls from the healer's toolkit bandages, sutures, and other tools. "Just a few minutes then we can move." He then sets to work addressing Beltias's wounds, starting with the most dangerous so he doesn't keel over before others get their chance.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-27 05:49:28):
Cardigan pauses then says:
"Well, I know you're an alchemist so you use your noggin instead of your instincts and intuition for treating the wounds of others, but you do a real good job of it."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-27 05:49:35):
Cardigan smiles at you warmly Rax.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-27 07:50:21):
"Had a good teacher or two. And plenty of practice." He chuckles and shakes his head. "It's amazing the stuff you see and the shit you have to fix after a night of drinking and brawlin'."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-29 01:06:54):
Cardigan:
"Should we tell the priest and his helper that everything will be fine?

Probably should also clean up the corpses...."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-29 04:01:07):
What next? :)

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-29 05:27:46):
"You can go ahead and do that. Sarenrae and I aren't on speaking terms. If it wasn't for him I wouldn't have taken one step in there." Rax ties off a suture and glances over to Cardigan.
