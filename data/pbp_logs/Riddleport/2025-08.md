Mad Rat:
"Shall we go up the tower?
He shouldn't be expecting us, we should use stealth."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 19:00:25):
Mad Rat:
"He will use his zip line escape, if he sees us coming."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 19:00:44):
Mad Rat:
"It's not a zip line, more like abseiling..."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-08-02 19:11:22):
"Do you know how high the tower is? Problem would solve itself if one of us could climb the tower from the outside and cut his rope. He tries to escape and falls to his doom. How good *are* you at climbing anyway, drunk cat?" Sinhow whispers, weighing the options. "I still wish we threw that old man out the window, but perhaps we can still throw someone out"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-08-05 20:46:12):
"Oh worry not, you won't be the predator. All you'll need to do is snip his repall line, so if he tries to run, he goes splat. Easy peazy"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-08-05 22:23:30):
"Right. Do you have something loud on you? Something that would make a tremendous amount of noise? Please do not show it off right now."

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-08-05 22:30:19):
Moonshine looks under her cloak as her hands flip through her various pouches on waist before pulling out a signal whistle.

“You could hear this baby from knots away! Let your crew know a ship was approaching from whole ‘nother side of an island!”

She takes a deep breath, about to immediately blow it before processing the warning, a pout following her confusion as she crosses her arms.

“Huh?!? What?! You deny the whistle its purpose! Why’d you even ask for it then?”

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-08-05 22:36:24):
Sinhow sighs, but without making noise. Just a big heaving breath. 

"Climb on up, cut the rope, climb down, blow the whistle. That'll tell us to burst into the room and scare him enough to hopefully escape, and fall down splat on the bottom of the tower. Not denying the whistle it's purpose, just using it to it's full potential. Alright?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-09 14:06:21):
Cardigan:
"So....what now?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-11 14:43:18):
Cardigan starts petting her mouse Eldamon.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-08-15 00:55:33):
"Sounds like a good plan overall. Do we have anything to help Moonshine accomplish their goal? It is an old building and has some good points to get a foothold but it is still a challenging climb overall."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:04:42):
Cardigan is listening. @RyoYamakawa

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-16 16:07:41):
"In case, I can climb up there as well."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-18 03:24:56):
Cardigan tells stories of the Heroes of Sandpoint's adventures to her Eldamon.

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-08-19 12:41:54):
Moonshine frowns, looking around as she tries to keep up with the conversation between the party’s planning and Cardigan’s idle emotes. Based on what she’s understanding, she’s already beginning to prepare her climbing kit as she looks over to the tower.

“Right, if everyone’s on board and decided on the plan, I guess it’s climbing time then…“

She narrows her eyes as she repeats the plan, extending a digit with each step as if trying to commit the process to memory.

“So climb da towa. Cut da rope. Whistle time! No, wait, whistle last? Climb down… first?”

The Amurrun looks down at her fingers, recounting the process as she start muttering a whole mnemonic to herself to remember the plan, scowling with frustration before shaking her head rapidly. With a quick swig from her gourd that seems to wash all her headaches away, her happy-go-lucky grin returns as she looks over Yaseitori.

“As long as Mr. Chicken’s with me, then I’m sure it’ll all be fine!! Chickens and cats are great descending heights, and I love chickens!”

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-19 15:23:30):
You leave the temple.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-19 15:23:36):
Walk around the temple.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-19 15:23:58):
And get to the tower part of the structure.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-19 15:23:58):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-19 15:24:10):
30 metres tall.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-19 15:24:19):
That's 100 feet.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-19 15:25:39):
That's going to be 5 feet per check.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-19 15:38:09):
And maybe they got a climb speed.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-21 01:46:31):
@CapriciousC 

Given a full idea of what climbing the tower will involve, are you still climbing?

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-08-21 01:47:25):
Yeah, as long as Yaseitori is climbing too, Moonshine will as well, just lemme get on foundry and roll the rest of the checks real quick

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-21 01:59:27):
@CapriciousC 

Let's start from scratch.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-21 01:59:34):
20 checks of DC 15.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-21 01:59:55):
If you get a 5 or a natural 1 then you need to use the climbing kit thing.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-21 02:04:15):
On 25 it should be +10, no ?

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-08-21 02:04:39):
Climbing kit halves my climb distance, unless you rule it halves my base before adding the additional 5 from crit

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-21 02:05:14):
Oh

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-21 02:05:16):

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-08-21 02:06:01):
Ye, having the lowered DC from 20 to 15 and the nat1 safeguard is a better trade off against not getting crits on 19 or nat 20

@CapriciousC Close one but nice work, over half way there.

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-08-21 02:17:23):
(I’m gonna wait for Yaseitori’s checks before I narrate Moonshine’s climb cause we’re probably climbing simultaneously.)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-21 06:44:01):
On a crit it's still 10feet. It halves your climbing speed but your base climbing speed is already 5. Criting adds 5 feet to the distance you climb not your climbing speed.
If you had a climbing speed of 20 for example, your climbing speed would be 10 with a climbing kit since it halves that, but when you crit you would climb 15ft since you add 5ft to the distance.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-21 06:45:56):
I'm pretty sure the halving happens before the increase from the crit basically or they are a different thing entirely. One being speed and the other distance

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-25 12:10:04):
Awesome!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-28 09:27:09):
You both find yourselves on a stone platform before two wide wooden doors.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-28 09:27:16):
The doors do not look to be locked.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-28 09:27:32):
There is some kind of mechanical climbing mechanism on the side of this landing pad.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-28 09:27:44):
Beyond those doors is the upper bell tower.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-28 09:27:49):
The highest point of the church.

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-08-28 15:42:40):
Just to make sure, the rope were meant to cut still isn’t accessible yet? We got a smaller tower to climb?

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-08-29 08:47:35):
Moonshine sets up the grappling hook, securing the climbing kit harness to herself as she starts ascending the tower, little by little. With one too many close calls and a few minutes of climbing, she finally pulls herself up on the platform before looking back down at the rope to make sure Yaseitori is following her. She squints up at the bell tower, shading her eyes from the sun before turning to Yaseitori.

“Uhh, what was the plan again? I don’t see any string to cut here…”

She walks over to the climbing mechanism and inspects it, wondering if it’s an installed elevator before looking back toward the door. They clearly seemed to lead up to the top of the bell tower. She scratches behind her head, a bit confused and deferring to Yaseitori

“Are we climbing stairs now?”

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 09:03:44):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 10:22:25):
Cardigan, meanwhile inside the temple of Sarenrae:
"I wonder how it's going in the bell tower."

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-08-29 11:25:11):
Moonshine approaches the doors and carefully push them open to peer inside.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 11:35:51):
It's a massive metal bell.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 11:36:02):
There are steps downstairs that descend in a spiral.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-31 16:49:01):
What next? :)
