**Kaer'maga when?** (2026-03-01 00:00:49):
Necrila says "My father is an oracle.
His domains are death, undeath and vigil.
Someone close to Elias Tammerhawk has asked him to enact his third domain. To remain vigil and to watch over Elias Tammerhawk.
I am a manifestation of his will for that matter. I am his daughter. His weapon tasked to reach out Elias and to scout and evolve."
Necrila pauses for a few seconds
"The rest of the information is classified and only for Elias Tammerhawk...... I have no ill intentions to hurt anyone related to them or allied with them.
I wish to speak no more of this unless we are lone
Too many vitality creatures here
Their allegiances unknown to me" Mira can see that when Necrila speaks about Elias she tries to avoid using "he" or "she".

**Kaer'maga when?** (2026-03-01 00:01:53):
Necrila flashes her endless rows of sharp teeth back

**Kaer'maga when?** (2026-03-01 00:03:58):
Necrila simply states 
"I am a voidborn,
You are a vitality form.
We are not the same.
Our views of the worlds are different.
To me your views are alien so are mines to you."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:04:09):
Callie:
"I normally stick my nose in, it's good as long as you don't end up losing it."

Callie smiles, a little less stressed out.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:04:52):
Callie:
"She'll make it up to me some other way.
She just doesn't know it yet."

Callie looks at Moonshine a bit mischievously.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:05:04):
Callie turns and freezes:

"Marlo!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:05:10):
Marlo has arrived.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:09:33):
Mira considers this.
Mira:
"You're right. 
We are not the same."

She picks up her book.

Mira:
"But the Sin Lords weren't the same as anything that came before them either. 
And they still found ways to reshape the world."

*@Nemesiux*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-03-01 00:09:52):
Mira:

"We have ran out of time. Marlo is here."
