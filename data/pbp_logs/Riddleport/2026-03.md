**Kaer'maga when?** (2026-03-01 00:00:49):
Necrila says "My father is an oracle.
His domains are death, undeath and vigil.
Someone close to Elias Tammerhawk has asked him to enact his third domain. To remain vigil and to watch over Elias Tammerhawk.
I am a manifestation of his will for that matter. I am his daughter. His weapon tasked to reach out Elias and to scout and evolve."
Necrila pauses for a few seconds
"The rest of the information is classified and only for Elias Tammerhawk...... I have no ill intentions to hurt anyone related to them or allied with them.
I wish to speak no more of this unless we are lone
Too many vitality creatures here
Their allegiances unknown to me" Mira can see that when Necrila speaks about Elias she tries to avoid using "he" or "she".
