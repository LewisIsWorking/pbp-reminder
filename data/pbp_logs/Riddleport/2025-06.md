Necril wins initiative with 24.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-10 05:11:41):
As the battle begins Badeye Rumblefist and Rasper Ellias both call out the injured scorpions.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-10 05:11:51):
The scorpions very weakly limp over to join the fight.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-10 05:12:02):

Being startled by the sudden appearance, Yaseitori looks around, seeing some scorpions which clearly don't look too friendly. 
He Hunter's Mark's the southern most scorpion and strides up to it before he focusses Ki Energy into his Beak and Fists with Inner Upheaval, making a Furry of Blows as part of it against the Scorpion.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-06-10 17:36:44):
The first attack misses, the second one hits for 10 Bludgeoning and 1 Force damage.

The scorpion needs to make a DC18 Fortitude Save (incapacitation) or be stunned.
(Idk why it says DC 0)
