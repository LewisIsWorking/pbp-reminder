**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-03 09:29:24):
@PathWars

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-03 09:40:43):
Jhonas the acolyte says:
"Yous gonna stand there or...."

Jhonas's body tenses:
"Or are you working with the group?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-03 15:35:21):
"As for your goddess in general he does hold her in high regards and pities her because of what her followers did to her at the Maw where they killed her herald.
Her reaction was understandable yet it could have killed us all .
Evil gods are terrible, yes , but mortals turning a good aligned god into an evil one is something that will always keep him alert"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-03 15:36:22):
"As for me I heed his advice and I tend to try and be polite as possible with gods and their mortal worshippers"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-03 15:37:17):
"Anyway is there something we can do to help you in exchange for soup for my friend Cardigan?
I am a weapon type of void shell
I can fight offensively or defensively"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-04 16:52:54):
Jhonas replies...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-04 17:08:45):
Jhonas says in a quieter voice, looking over his shoulder at the current service and father Patrick:
"I do not wish to speak ill of father Patrick for he saved my life and turned it around but the group keep giving him bottles of wine and it leaves him with little of his mental capacity left....
I think it is to keep him placated."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-04 17:57:29):
"Either hide the wine or empty it and replace it with water and use prestigidacion to change it color to purple"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 03:38:08):
Father Patrick is still praying with the congregation.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 16:49:26):
So what happens next? :)

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-10 14:25:35):
"Don't forget that most if not all the cities in Varisia have these 'monuments' they are the remains of the old empire"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-10 14:40:34):
Jhonas:
"I've only spoken to him a couple of times but every time he asks me to have tea and biscuits with his cat!"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-10 14:44:29):
"How does he look like?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-10 14:54:03):
The prayers end with Father Patrick saying:
"And with every dusk will come the <hic> dawn."

And Father Patrick rises uneasily and comes over to the group:
"Hello hello, I am father Patrick <hic> sorry must have been my <hic> what brings such a varied group to our doorstep?

Mercenaries?
Seeking healing?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-10 14:58:58):
Father Patrick chimes in:
"If we are talking of the mage, I think he may be planning on moving soon, he is good friends with the Dwarves of the gas forges and has been on several *hiccups* trips to their sky cities.
I think someone said he plans on going for a longer stay, over a decade even!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-10 14:59:06):
Jhonas looks doubtful at this.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-10 15:00:09):
Father Patrick:
"There's nothing wrong with your head in a book, you could do for *hiccup* studying more yourself!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 02:57:17):
Father Patrick snaps his fingers and slurs his words slightly:
"I remember now.
Cardigan.
That's the name given by Yubis to one of those Gnomish babies she found recently."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 02:57:47):
Father Patrick laughs wholeheartedly:
"And to think I thought it to be a silly name.
Cardigan and Boggly."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 02:58:00):
Cardigan's eyes go wide but says nothing.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 02:58:31):
Father Patrick says:
"Well, what a funny coincidence.
Welcome to the temple of Sarenrae, how can we help?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:15:32):
Cardigan turns away at the mention of the orphanage.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-13 23:28:50):
Necrila turns to Cardigan "What now?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:47:54):
You go back to the front hall.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:47:58):
The group go up the stairs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:48:09):
You are in a large hallway with many many corridors and doors.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:48:14):
Up here is a mess.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:48:37):
The stone floor of the hallway is covered in rubbish, sleeping bags, used needles and general mess.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:48:47):
Dog shit fills several cast iron bowls.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:48:51):
The smell is very bad.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:49:33):
Tall once-fancy now very dirty windows are spaced out around the room, the windows are over 5 feet tall and have decorative glass stain art of flowers on fire.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:49:56):
A big fat numbskull brute of a man sits playing with a mangy scruffy dog.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:50:35):
The dog has 3 legs with the 4 leg missing and has thick bright yellow hair, well, the hair would be bright if the dog wasn't so filthy.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:51:04):
Caroline says:
"This is Knuckles" referring to the man.

Then says:
"And this is Fetch" referring to the dog.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:51:31):
Knuckle's bald head looks over at you all lazily and he gives you a dull passively aggressive gaze.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:51:50):
Caroline:
"Follow me."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:52:34):
You go down several corridors and stop.

The rooms of the 2nd level are numbered like a hotel.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:52:43):
Caroline has taken you outside of room 9.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:53:20):
Caroline opens the door of room 9.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:54:00):
There is a desk with a copper lantern on it.

The lantern is not lit.

There are two bedrolls on either side of the room.

Two men are here.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:55:26):
Caroline says:
"Balston, Mad Rat, here they are.
If you need anything more from me, don't bother, I am going to the kitchens, I hear Mummy is making soup."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:56:04):
Balston is an old man with strong arms, thin black hair, scars cover his face and exposed arms.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:56:25):
Balston looks calm despite the tension of the situation.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:56:34):
Balston has clearly been around the block many times.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:57:02):
Mad Rat is the polar opposite.

When Balston sits at the desk going through papers, Mad Rat has blue and green dyed hair, he looks to be in his mid twenties.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:57:41):
Mad Rat is wearing ripped clothing, has many studs and piercings and is currently tossing a wicked dagger in the air and catching it over and over again.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:57:51):
Balston:
"Please, come in, take a seat."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:58:09):
Balston looks at Mad Rat:
"Mad Rat, get them chairs from the other room."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:58:47):
Mad Rat looks immediately annoyed then laughs:
"Yeah yeah boss man, I'll get you your chairs."

Mad Rat moves past the group leering in close as he moves past, clearly trying to psyche the group out.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:59:03):
A moment later Mad Rat comes back with enough chairs for the group.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-13 23:59:32):
Balston clears his throat:
"So, what brings your group to the temple of Sarenrae? Looking for a blessing because I ain't no priest."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-14 00:05:17):
Necrila turns at Cardigan and then at Balton
 "Greetings, I am Necrila daughter of the Chronicler.
 I wish to know why are you here? 
The priests have been polite and kind. Why cause them trouble?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-14 00:07:55):
Mad Rat yells:
"Wanker! Who are you to..."

Balton shoots mad rat a single, hard look.

Mad Rat settles down and goes back to dagger tossing.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-14 08:51:57):
Necrila just like a cat loses interest in these people. She instead looks at Cardigan: "This is your home. Your choice friend. Your wish is my command"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-14 11:42:36):
Cardigan looks quite worked up.
💥💥💥💥💥💥💥

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-14 11:43:52):
Balton may not have heard everything but he visibly becomes suspicious:
"I'm not a fan of all this whispering.

You taking on the work or what?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-14 11:44:38):
COMBAT.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-14 11:45:57):
Or initiative with society?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 04:38:51):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 04:39:49):
Necrila wins initiative.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 04:39:50):
27.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 04:39:53):
Players go first.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-16 04:49:58):
Filliaur will support the party first.
Drawing runes in the air with a chalk bit as she will invoke:
"COSAIN" (the protective wards).
She will then launch a magically charged chalk at one of them that will bounce between them(casting ricochet).

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 05:15:01):
Cardigan's turn.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 05:15:11):
Elemental effusion.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 05:15:48):
Phase Eldamon.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 05:35:18):
Cardigan phases into Cardigan's Meese.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 05:35:26):
Cardigan's Meese uses addling blast.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 05:35:35):
It KILLS Balston.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 05:35:42):
Then tail attacks Mad Rat.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 05:35:46):
CRITICAL HIT.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 05:35:48):
2 damage!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 05:35:55):
Mad Rat is badly injured.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 05:36:02):
And looks to be trying to flee.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 05:36:07):
Rather than surrender.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-17 04:50:13):
No

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-17 04:50:20):
I will do it today

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-17 07:41:32):
can you switch to df when you have the time?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-17 08:42:02):
I can do that now.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-17 08:42:25):
thanks

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-17 08:52:30):

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-17 09:06:58):
last action was an attack which missed

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-17 09:11:04):
So 2 damage then 2 more damage?

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-17 09:16:31):
it is double slice

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-17 09:17:01):
so 4 dmg and then a miss

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-17 09:36:08):
Enemy's turn.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-17 09:36:11):
Mad Rat's turn.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-17 09:36:21):
Mad Rat is barely standing.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-17 09:38:00):
Mad Rat wildly slices in the air at Necrila's face.

Necrilia, you step backwards and all 3 strikes critically fail.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-17 09:38:09):
Player's turn.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-17 09:38:52):
Mad Rat, heavily injured says in a COMPLETELY different voice:
"Right, guys.
Look, lemme explain.
I am not even with these guys."

And drops his daggers.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-17 09:40:13):
Necrila enraged "Kneel and beg for forgiveness and tells us about the other gang members or else the sun goddess be my witness that I will devour you in the name of all the people you wronged
This is your only chance to repent no more or less!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-17 10:11:54):
Mad Rat: 
"A lotta explain man, a lotta explain."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-17 10:16:12):
"What is your group goal? Who is Mummy?"

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-17 19:03:52):
Filiaur will cast rousing splash on mad rat to give her temp hp hopefully preventing her from bleeding out and also 'waterboard' her.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-17 19:09:12):
*[image]* She gains 2 temp hp which should absorb the bleeding

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-17 19:09:28):
"Someone bandage her up before she starts to bleed out..."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-17 19:13:45):
Necrila hisses "Fine!
I will heal the rude mortal."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-17 19:14:10):
*[image]*

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-17 19:15:10):
"I don't have them!"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-03-17 19:20:47):
Sinhow looks down at the situation, and bends a little to examine the wounds. 
"I ain't got any either. My blood don't work the same way yours dose, I don't keep any. Maybe put some dirt into it so the blood doesn't keep spilling out?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-17 19:23:08):
"Someone should find Jhonas and ask him for bandages

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 15:50:52):
Cardigan will attempt to heal Mad Rat.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 15:51:06):
Cardigan says:
"You know, we are from the same town, we don't gotta be enemies."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 15:51:17):
Mad Rat looks a little surprised at that but doesn't protest.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 15:52:16):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 15:52:22):
Cardigan rubs her hands together.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 15:52:51):
Cardigan's hands glow with a cosmic green glow, quite different from her normal purple magic.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 15:53:21):
Cardigan's hands upon touching Mad Rat's wounds swirl with green light, little stars and planets that meld into Mad Rat's flesh, knitting it together.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 15:53:31):
Mad Rat is BLOODY and NOT FEELING GOOD.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 15:53:34):
But not dying.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 15:53:54):
Mad Rat wipes some of their own blood from their clothing and says:
"Cheers."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 15:56:47):
Mad Rat continues:
"Right, so I don't work for this gang.

I work for Avery Slyeg.

Two words: Beltias Kreun.

Avery Slyeg thinks the cunt is here, and Mr Slyeg had me put on this whole show and dance that I had walked out from the River River Runner Inn in the Leeward District."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 16:03:51):
Mad Rat continues:
"Anyways, Marlo Kaspar Viktor Cyrus.
The bloke looking to clean up the city a bit, which the crime lords have....mixed feelings on.

Stability is good for business, business is good, but not....too stable. Not too clean."

Mad Rat waves his hand dismissively:
"Point is.
A few people want Beltias Kreun dead.

Get me fully healed, we shouldn't be bothered in here plus I want to go through Balston's desk.

Balston is the info broker of the gang he's got a fair amount of eyes and ears from decades in the business."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 16:05:27):
Mad Rat looks at Balston's corpse, the skull has swelled from the psychic assault that killed him, a puddle of blood pools around his head:
"Well, decades don't mean you're untouchable. 
And he never saw much of a scrap, or any.
No killing, no power, no power no defence."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 16:05:50):
Mad Rat looks upon the group:
"You could use another set of daggers, so whatcha say?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 16:06:38):
Mad Rat smiles a little bit:
"Mr Cyrus has gold, it is the name of his business after all.
You'll all get paid."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 16:50:00):
Mad Rat continues:
"Geezer Pidge runs the pidgeons, the old man will absolutely destroy us. We cannot fight him."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 16:52:14):
Mad Rat says:
"Garspheal Elstrice and Brandy Nurrus.

Gar the elf is the gang's sniper.

Brandy is the gang's medic and appearance changer.

Brandy breaks noses, applies makeup, chisels teeth.

They shouldn't be too much of an issue as long as we keep Brandy at a distance and Gar up close, melee and range basically."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 16:54:19):
Mad Rat continues:
"Then there's Rasper Ellias and Badeye Rumblefist.

Rasper is an angry midget and Rumblefist is an angry orc.

Their whole thing is that they claim to be Scorpion handlers.

What they actually do is just chuck crates of scorpions at people."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 16:56:15):
Mad rat concludes:
"Then that just leaves Beltias.
Beltias Kreun.

He is up in the Bell Tower, plotting shit.

IF we give him ANY idea this is happening then it's game over and he will escape.

IF he does escape it's not a complete shit show.

We've crippled his gang and Crime lord Avery Slyeg, my boss, can put out feelers for him and kill him before he gets another foot hold like this shit hole again."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 16:59:57):
Also after Necrila and Cardigan's heals, Mad Rat is slightly injured with a few nasty wounds and a lot of scrapes.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-19 17:20:31):
Necrila once again has a wide smile and crosses her arms on her chest the same way Cardinal did to Selenor in the past "I will make my family proud!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 17:24:37):
Mad Rat laughs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 17:26:24):
Mad Rat adds:
"Crimelord Avery AND semi-retired Crimelord Marlo Kaspar Viktor Cyrus."

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-19 17:27:28):
"We're just here to get soup and got into a whole crimelord war plot... Well then we'll help just to get the church back to normal opperations "

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-19 17:28:04):
Filiaur will still do a sense motive on that though(can't cause you should've vaulted the riddleport characters):

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-19 17:28:45):
"I shall keep their skulls as trophies, maybe even make a cloak out of them"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 17:40:05):
*[image]*

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-03-19 19:48:19):
The twigs and vines where the forehead of a normal person would shrivel and seem to twitch. "I'm all up for killing ne'er-do-wells and bandits, but would Seranrae frown upon slaughter in her church? I don't want to incur the wrath of the gods and the wrath of a crime gang. Not a good way to keep the leaves on my head, yaknow?" 
Sinhow seems a bit restless as he speaks, shifting his weight from foot to foot

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-03-19 20:27:26):
"Right Cardigan. I don't know my blessings from my curses as I didn't have many religions in the forest so forgive me if I'm wrong, but isn't Saranrae the goddess of Redemption?" 
 Sinhow turns to Cardigan, and it seems like the branches and twigs that make up his ear slightly expand, as if to listen better.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-21 14:57:32):
"You  forget that people choose to be good or evil"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-03-22 03:46:19):
"Well alrighty fair enough. Do we have a plan of action, which one are we goin' after first?" 
The swelling in Sinhows wooden ear goes down, he puts a hand on the handle of his sword, ready to head out.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:25:26):
Cardigan says:
"I think we should stop them breathing."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-22 22:36:10):
Necrila looks confused "why did you hit my hand?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-22 22:44:24):
