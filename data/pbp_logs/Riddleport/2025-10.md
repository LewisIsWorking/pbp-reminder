**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-03 23:51:55):
So

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-03 23:57:00):
Acted:

#1 Necrila ✓
#2 Professor Filiaur Bluestar ✓
#3 Sinhow ✓
#5 Lenma Moonshine ✓
#6 Cardigan Green ✓
#7 Rax ✓
Still needs to act:

#4 Yaseitori (already at the top with Kreun, but hasn't taken their Round 2 turn yet)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-04 00:11:56):
> Yaseitori's turn.
>> - Action 1: Demoralise.
>> - Roll total = 20.
>> - Result = Failure.
>> - Action 2: Hunt prey.
>> - Action 3: Tiger stance.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-10-04 00:12:16):
*[image]* Yaseitori attempts to startle Kreun, but fails. As he wants to see what Kreun does first, Yaseitori uses Hunt Prey and goes into Tiger Stance.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-04 00:12:48):
Beltias Kreun:
"Your in my way."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-04 00:13:15):
He speaks with a hint of panic in his voice but there is a way he holds himself: he knows what he is doing, he is a killer.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-10-04 00:13:16):
"There's plenty of space to go around."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-10-04 00:14:28):
(No)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-04 00:14:59):
Beltias Kreun's face becomes more neutral in expression:
"How many of you lot are there?"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-10-04 00:19:05):
"I'm alone up here." Yaseitori response, his tone also fairly neutral.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-10-04 00:20:15):
"But I don't recommend going back downstairs."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-04 00:20:37):
Beltias Kreun:
"You weren't whistling that for no reason."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-10-04 00:20:38):
"4 or 5?"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-10-04 00:21:27):
"Have a nice day."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-04 00:27:12):
The abseil device is jury rigged

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-04 00:27:21):
But it was NOT placed back at the top of the platform.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-04 00:27:27):
From my understanding

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-04 01:17:18):
> Beltias Kreun's turn.
>> - Beltias Kreun is going to cross to where the boobytrapped mechanical magical abseil device is.
>> - Moonshine has previously boobytrapped the abseiling device to break.
>> - Beltias Kreun A1: stride.
>> - Beltias Kreun A2+3: use a device to use the abseiling equipment, hooked in, he jumps off and the cord snaps.
>> - Beltias Kreun will start to fall.
>> - Beltias Kreun will grab an edge.
>> - 32 on the acrobatics roll.
>> - Call fall: If you are an expert in Acrobatics, treat falls as 25 feet shorter.
>> - Beltias Kreun, holds onto the edge of the platform, looks down.
>> - It is clear that Beltias Kreun does not have any/many options and opens his grip.
>> - Beltias Kreun falls.
>> - Crunch. PLOD. 
>> - As Beltias Kreun hits the ground, he tries to land into a roll, which he does, but there is clearly the sound of bone cracking as he hits the ground.
>> - Beltias Kreun did not take full damage, Beltias Kreun landed on his feet like a cat!
>> - Beltias Kreun is now prone as he took damage.
>> - End of turn.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-10-04 11:51:22):
Sinhow's passive perception should be 20. Would he be able to hear Kreun fall and splat against the floor?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-04 12:37:38):
Yaseitori has certainly seen it tho.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-09 01:35:04):
^ Round 3.

Who is going first?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-11 14:17:05):
Who is going first?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-13 23:56:51):
Who is going first?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-13 23:56:58):
@Nemesiux 
@MrNegetZ 
@Mossssssssssssssssssssssssss 
@Askarans 
@CapriciousC 
@PathWars 
@RyoYamakawa

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-10-14 01:00:03):
When are you going to switch to World 1 so we can go?

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-10-14 01:00:11):
@PathWars

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 03:17:43):
Ok so I am gonna summarise your turn.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 04:08:00):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 04:08:15):
@RyoYamakawa Quick bomber?

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-10-16 04:10:37):
Yes, also shouldn't be a crit fail

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 04:14:27):
*[image]* I have no idea where this is coming from...

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-10-16 04:50:34):
It isn't a crit fail though. A crit fail is 10 below target which it isn't. There is something messed up there.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 05:36:54):
Success.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 05:37:05):
And he takes 1 damage?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 05:37:32):
He is still injured.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 05:37:35):
After the 1 damage.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-10-16 05:37:35):
Yes, but nothing happens because of the step up from him taking the splash damage instead of the full hit.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 05:37:52):
Ok

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 05:38:29):
@RyoYamakawa Your actions was: stride + stride + quick bomber?

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-10-16 05:38:58):
Since you never told me how far I was from the actual edge from the top of the stairs, probably?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 05:44:24):
To get to the edge.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 05:44:30):
Does that mean you are going to strike again ?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 05:46:25):
@RyoYamakawa I can roll for you if you want?

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-10-16 05:47:56):
Can't hurt I guess. I have one more Skunk Bomb so can use Quick Bomber again

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 05:48:26):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 05:48:33):
-6 range penalty sound correct ?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 05:48:55):
*[image]*

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-10-16 05:49:00):
Oh yeah, map

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 05:49:03):
That's a fail so 1 damage?

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-10-16 05:49:03):

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-10-16 05:49:18):
Yes, and another dc 15 fort save

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 05:49:23):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 05:49:43):
21.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 05:49:47):
On the fort save.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-10-16 05:49:58):
So 2 damage from two bombs lol

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 05:52:37):
Mad Rat:

- Crossbow strike: hit. 4 damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-16 20:20:49):
Cardigan:
"He's fallen, he's hurt but he ain't dead!"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-10-16 20:39:03):
Sinhow, almost out of breathe yells "shit" and starts rushing down the stairs with his actions to stride his movement speed. So he's now 30/35 feet high? Ish

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-10-17 14:12:19):
I assume 10 feet of movement isn't enough to jump out the window?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-17 14:35:30):
That's a fair point I suppose

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-10-21 04:23:09):
Filiaur will command puppet.
"PUPPET!!! YOU BETTER NOT LET THE BASTARD ESCAPE"
puppet will approach the guy and grab him.
Then she'll start descending the stairs.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-10-21 09:21:23):
Cause we started where he is right?
Also he better have a token to target.
Also need to switch to world 1 to do that.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-10-21 09:25:58):
He does, it's to the left of us on the map. I assume it's just for convenience since he doesn't have a map showing the outside and the top of the bell tower.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-21 10:14:25):
As it's meant to be fast enough paced to not need maps 😅

*[image]* Apparently bro is grabbed(cost a hero point but I did it).

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-10-31 12:35:15):
Sinhow has acted
