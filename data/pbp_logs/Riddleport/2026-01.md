**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 04:34:28):
Cardigan comes back to the group, smacking her hands together:
"A hard job well done."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 04:34:49):
Behind her you see a fire rising on the roof of the temple.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 04:35:05):
Cardigan explains:
"They are burning the corpses, giving them last rites and all."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-01-03 05:07:54):
"And I've got him patched up, somewhat. And gift wrapped for the crimelord. Ready to head on out?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 07:21:42):
Cardigan stops and says:
"Uh...where are we going?"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-01-03 07:27:23):
Rax turns to look over at Mad Rat.

"You gotta lead the way. I never got to meet the ones with the real power during my time in."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 07:27:48):
Mad Rat sighs and says:
"Very well...."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 07:27:56):
Mad Rat explains he knows the way.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 07:37:55):
Cardigan:
"Also, before we continue, the priest gave me this from the bell tower."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 07:39:16):
Cardigan opens her back pack, inside it is:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 07:47:45):
- Dozens of papers on Kreun's operations in Riddleport. They are cyphered (DC 20 society check).
- Two potions of Gecko Grip. 
- A wand of Thunderstrike.
- A pouch of flay leaf with a street value of 12 gold pieces.
- 32 GP.
- 256 SP
- 400 CP.
- A short sword with a pommel made of pure quartz  (30 GP of added value to the short sword's original value of 9 SP).
- A silver anklet chain (22 GP).
- A signet ring of Korvosa’s "Ornelos" family (5 GP).
- An ornate brass candelabra (15 GP).
- A bronze knocker in the shape of a dolphin (10 GP).
- A folding marlin spike (2 GP).
- A set of sailing charts in a leather tube (250 GP). 
- An anchor feather token. 
- Sea charts (unknown value).
- Gambling casino chips (unknown value). 
- A magically captured image of an unknown girl (magical picture, not much inherent value). 
- 50 feet of spare rope.
- Spare grappling hook.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 07:49:05):
Cardigan, upon seeing the contents of her backpack, starts to cry:
"He....he gave me all of Kreun's loot....I....he could have fixed the temple with this money!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 07:49:50):
Cardigan (through tears) says:
"I....I....WAAAAAAAAAAA."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 07:52:02):
Cardigan:
"THIS is the priest I know, the one who would do anything to help me...."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 07:52:33):
Cardigan looks at the group:
"We need to do whatever we can to help make the priest and Riddleport safer!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 07:55:02):
Mad Rat eyes the treasure and gold, then shakes his head and says:
"I said I'd give you the treasure, didn't think there would be quite so much...."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-01-03 08:10:46):
Rax rolls his eye, glad he has his mask on because he doesn't want to be an asshole. Then taking a moment before he speaks to keep the hate out.

"He sounds like a decent guy. Not sure about Riddleport, but might be able to get a few words to the right people over time so that he's kept out of further trouble."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 10:24:47):
Cardigan:
"Yay, new friends are super duper nice!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 10:55:50):
Mad Rat leads the party through Riddleport for about 10 minutes.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 10:55:57):
You see the wilds of the pirate city.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 10:56:43):
Crazy mid-day parties, constant fighting, loud music, loud machines.

Constantly crime, sin and villainy everywhere.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 10:57:02):
Mad Rat stops at a small pawn shop and says:
"Wait here a moment."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 10:58:14):
As people walk past, no one bats an eye at your prisoner, as many handcuffed/restrained individuals make their way past the group.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 10:58:23):
Mad Rat pops out a few minutes later.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 11:02:55):
Mad Rat:
"So...News."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 11:05:06):
Mad Rat looks hesitantly optimistic:
"So Crimelord Cyrus has already heard what we all did.

He's very happy and wants to see us. All. Right now.

With Beltias.

Wouldn't be surprised if Lord Cyrus executes him....but....

Mr Cyrus is a businessman, very legit guy.

Like I said, he's a bit controversial for his non-violent business approach."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-03 11:08:48):
Mad Rat:
"Well. This day gets stranger by the minute."

Mad Rat cracks his back, straightening up:
"Ready to go to the Silver Succubi night club, strip club, casino?"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-01-04 16:22:07):
Rax looks between the two of them and shakes his head.

"I'm ready as soon as the odd couple here are."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2026-01-05 16:12:32):
Necrila confused and hungry simply states "I don't understand you vitality lifeforms. I am hungry can we move on and finish your business so I can find an evil mortal and feed on them?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-10 22:47:41):
The party is about to arrive at the Silver Succubus.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-14 08:20:51):
-= ARRIVAL AT THE SILVER SUCCUBI =-

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-14 08:21:04):
1. Mad Rat leads the party through the winding chaos of Riddleport's streets until the buildings thin and a wide plaza opens before you.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-14 08:22:49):
2. The Silver Succubi dominates the corner lot like a fever dream made architectural.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-14 08:22:58):
3. Where other establishments in this neglected district have surrendered to rot and salt-wind decay, this one gleams with deliberate, vulgar opulence.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-14 08:23:19):
4. A massive brass half-dome crowns the building, tarnished to a greenish-bronze patina that somehow makes the structure look more expensive rather than neglected

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-14 08:23:40):
5. The building looks like the kind of old money that doesn't need to prove itself.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-14 08:24:44):
6. Wide verandas wrap the front between two short wings, currently occupied by a mix of sailors, merchants, and figures whose professions are best left unasked.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-14 08:24:54):
7. Standing before the main doors is an eight-foot statue of a succubus, cast in silver-plated bronze.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-14 08:25:02):
8. She balances on one cloven hoof atop a pile of coins, her wings spread wide, her expression one of knowing invitation.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-14 08:25:14):
9. One finger is pressed to her full lips in a gesture of secrecy.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-14 08:25:19):
10. Her other hand extends palm-up toward the entrance, as if personally welcoming each patron into damnation.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-14 08:25:27):
11. The doors themselves are dark imported wood, each panel carved with imagery that becomes increasingly explicit the longer you look

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-14 08:25:52):
12. Carved into the doors are symbols of luck and fortune that gradually reveal themselves to be tangled limbs, grasping hands, and suggested acts that would make Calistria herself raise an eyebrow.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-14 08:26:02):
13. Through those doors, the thrum of music pulses like a heartbeat.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-14 08:26:09):
14. Clockwork instruments grind out a low, sensual rhythm while arcane lights in shades of crimson and violet sweep across the interior visible through the windows.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-14 08:26:43):
Mad Rat pauses at the base of the steps:
"Right, uh...
Guys. 
So. 
Fair warning."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-14 08:31:20):
Mad Rat scratches behind one ear, considering his next words carefully while a sneak look over his shoulder ensures that the bouncers are not overhearing:

"Mr Cyrus is not like all the other Crime Lords of Riddleport.

The Crime Lord in there (Mr Cyrus), well, he runs a pretty... legitimate business. 

Very above-board. 

Very professional."

Mad Rat holds up 4 fingers and lists off 4 things:

"The dancers are employees, not slaves. 

The games aren't rigged, or at least, not badly rigged. 

No one gets roughed up without a damn good reason...

and finally the drinks are actual alcohol, not watered piss served in many of the other shit hole dive bars in this city..."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-14 08:31:46):
Mad Rat glances at Beltias Kreun, still bound by Rax:
"Which is why bringing this piece of shit to his doorstep is either going to make us either very popular or very, very dead."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-14 08:35:04):
Mad Rat straightens his coat and slicks back some of his rainbow coloured hair:
"The man's full name is Marlo Kaspar Viktor Cyrus. 

Everyone calls him Marlo.

You call him Mr Cyrus, or don't talk at all. 

He's missing his left hand.

He lost it to some nasty business years back. 

Now, Mr Cyrus has got himself a clockwork hand that always clutches a magical skeleton key. 

Please don't stare at it. 

Please don't ask about it. 

And please for the love of Besmara, DO NOT make hand jokes."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-14 08:35:55):
Mad Rat even more quietly:

"Shit.

We might get out of this alive.

Don't fuck it up and we might be very very happy pirates by the end of this."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-14 08:36:56):
Mad Rat takes a deep breath of the salty sea air.

The air whistles through Mad Rat's gold teeth, and Mad Rat says with no hesitation, ready to face the odds:

"Are ya ready, kids?"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-01-14 08:47:25):
Rax looks between the rest of the crew and Mad Rat before nodding.

"Ready as I'll ever be. Maybe can bond with the Crime Lord over shared trauma if worse comes to worst."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-01-14 18:23:04):
Rax sighs as he pinches the bridge of the mask's 'beak' and shakes his head.

"Maybe tone it down a little. We already have eyes on us, no need to draw more attention than we already have. Especially when walking into the lion's den."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-01-14 18:42:30):
Turning his attention back to the nervous pointman he smirks into the mask.

"Let's just say we both have some experience with things getting nasty."

As he says that he taps his right hand against the opulent statue, the familiar sound of metal meeting metal could be faintly heard over the cacophony of sound from inside.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 12:46:50):
-= INSIDE THE SILVER SUCCUBI =-

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 12:48:00):
The doors swing open.

The party enter.

...and the establishment's entrance swallows you all whole.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 12:48:16):
You walk through a very short entrance hallway.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 12:48:24):
Several bouncers look you all up and down.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 12:48:35):
These guys are the door staff.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 12:49:25):
A mean, older one-eyed orc, with a name badge that says "Davy Crab-Basket" gives you all nothing more than a sideways glance and a short nod.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 12:49:38):
Davy recognises who Beltias is.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 12:50:07):
You get the idea that Davy is a mid-tier fighter.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 12:50:22):
Aka he could literally kill you all very, very quickly.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 12:50:38):
Well, if it wasn't for his dodgy knee.... his bad back.... his old age... his missing eye....

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 12:50:41):
Etc. Etc. Etc.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 12:51:16):
You pass through some simple double doors made of black stone.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 12:52:07):
The smell.

The first thing that hits you is the smell.

Pipe smoke layered over expensive perfume.

The sharp bite of quality alcohol. 

The musk of too many bodies pressed together...

and beneath it all, something faintly sulfurous. 

Brimstone. 

Whether real Brimstone or an alchemical affectation for the theme, it works.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 12:52:40):
The Sound.

The second thing is the sound.

A wall of noise that takes a moment to parse. 

The grinding rhythm of clockwork instruments. 

The clatter of dice. 

The shuffle of cards. 

Laughter, cursing, the clink of glasses, and somewhere a woman moaning in a way that might be theatrical or might not be.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 12:53:12):
The Heat.

The third thing is the heat. 

Braziers burn throughout the room, and with this many bodies packed inside, the air is thick, warm and dank. 

Each of you is sweating before you have taken three steps.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 12:53:23):
@RyoYamakawa Rax is probably sweating even more, considering his mask.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 13:15:29):
The Casino.

The casino floor sprawls before you.- 

It is a wide room carpeted in rich crimson carpet that's been recently patched in several places.

These patchy repairs somehow add to the lived-in decadence rather than detracting from the theme of the establishment.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 13:16:56):
The carpet is soft underfoot; it seems to be swallowing your footsteps. 

You feel your footsteps muffled and with a bit of depth as you press down.

Here and there you spot stains that didn't quite come out - wine, blood, or something else entirely. 

No one notices these stains, regardless of their...nature.

No one seems to care.

Their attention is placed elsewhere.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 13:19:07):
The room is massive.

It is easily 100+ metres across and twice as long. 

Pillars of dark wood carved with writhing figures support the structure, each one depicting a different scene of temptation & sin. 

One pillar shows a man drowning in gold coins. 

Another pillar shows a woman wrapped in serpents. 

A third pillar shows something each of you would need to look at more closely to understand.

Given what it seems to be showing, some of you may be too innocent.

Cardigan likes the look of them all.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 13:19:28):
The games of the casino.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 13:20:10):
There are GAMING TABLES spread throughout the chamber.

Dozens and dozens of them.

Each table is its own island of green felt in the sea of crimson carpet.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 13:22:31):
Bounder.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 13:22:57):
At the nearest table, a game of Bounder is in progress. 

A ghoulish severed head mounted on a mechanical arm insults each player in turn, its dead eyes rolling, its grey tongue wagging obscenities. 

The players roar with laughter and/or curses as coins slide into slots beneath its chin.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 13:31:58):
Ghoulette.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 13:32:33):
Beyond that, a Ghoulette wheel spins.

It's not exactly roulette, but something distinctly from and made in Riddleport.

The wheel is divided into segments painted with leering undead faces. 

A skeletal mechanical hand drops the ball.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 13:32:46):
Skiffs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 13:32:48):
A cluster of sailors crowd around a Skiffs board, arguing over the placement of colored tokens on a nine-square grid while a bored dealer referees.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 13:33:03):
Golem.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 13:33:24):
At the back, serious-faced men and women play Golem.

This is a card game that looks like poker until you notice the "golem hand".

This is a pile of discarded cards in the centre that can steal victory from the best player at the table.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 13:34:15):
The Ceiling.

SILKEN BANNERS in deep purple and black hang from floor to ceiling along the walls. 

Each one is over 5 metres tall, embroidered with silver succubus silhouettes.

**Lunnes** (2026-01-22 16:21:44):
In the bar has a goblin with a drink and a gloomy face on the balcanie, literaly on it since he is so short that the rest of his body is hanging from it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:22:12):
Each banner has a Silver Succubi. 

Each Silver Succubi is posing.

The Silver Succubi poses start tasteful near the entrance.

The party see a the winged figure of a Silver Succubi lounging about.

Another of Silver Succubi is mid-flight.

But.
As the banners go across the walls, each Silver Succubi grows increasingly explicit as your eye travels deeper into the hall. 

By the time you look at the banners on the far wall, the embroidered succubi are engaged in acts that would make a Calistrian priestess take notes, maybe even blush...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:23:27):
WIDE VERTICAL BLINDS 

The blinds cover the windows, blocking any hint of the outside world. 

It's always night inside the Silver Succubi, regardless of what the sun thinks. 

This is a classic, well known casino/night club/strip club design.

You could lose hours in here.

Maybe even days of your life.

You would never ever know... until you leave.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:24:00):
The walls.

The walls themselves are painted a deep burgundy where they're visible between the banners. 

The walls are mounted with brass sconces shaped like clutching demonic hands, each one holding an ever-burning torch that flickers in shades of violet.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:24:35):
The magical torches illuminate the room while allowing darkness to pool and the room has a fire-like flickering light.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:26:14):
The FALSE CEILING.

The ceiling seems to end 7ish metres up, draped in layers of gauzy fabric in shades of violet and crimson, like frozen smoke or the inside of a massive tent.

The fabric shifts slightly in the warm air currents, creating the illusion of breathing or movement.

Above this ceiling, you catch glimpses of movement.

It's unclear what this is.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:26:59):
CLOCKWORK CHANDELIERS.

These chandeliers hang below the false ceiling, massive brass contraptions that rotate slowly on what must be hidden mechanisms. 

Their Crystal prisms catch the light and scatter it in sweeping beams of crimson and violet that play across the gaming floor.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:28:30):
COPPER ENCHANTED BRAZIERS.

Around the room are braziers the size of bathtubs.

They squat at intervals around the room, filled with live coals that pop and hiss. 

The hellish orange light mingles with the arcane violet, painting everyone in shades that make them look either beautiful or damned, depending on the angle.

Their purpose is less to provide light (as there are ever-burning torches for that) but rather to provide warmth & atmosphere.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:30:36):
THE STAFF.

The staff are like sharks; they move through the throng of people with intent and purpose.

The serving staff are all wearing succubus costumes that leave almost nothing to the imagination.

They are wearing bat wings of black leather or silk strapped to their backs, small devil horns affixed to elaborate hairstyles and forked tails that swing as they walk. 

Their outfits are variations on the theme: 
corsets, 
stockings, 
heeled boots
and strategic placement of silver chains and black lace. 

Male and female alike, they're uniformly attractive.

That's clearly a hiring requirement.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:32:27):
The bouncers are a different breed entirely. 

The bouncers outside were warriors, meant for the big trouble.

The inside bouncers are enforcers of the rules.

Big. 
Many of them have multiple scars. 
Watching. All the time.

Each inside bouncer is wearing a tight black leather suit, and they have expressions that suggest they've seen everything and are deeply bored by all of it. 

Each one carries a sword and a pistol at a minimum.

Each of you would likely bet serious coin that there are other weapons hidden on their persons.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:32:52):
THE STAGE.

A STAGE dominates the eastern wall, raised three feet above the casino floor and framed by heavy black curtains trimmed in silver.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:33:28):
On the stage are a clockwork band and a trio of dancers.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:34:27):
The trio of dancers currently work the brass poles that extend from the stage all the way up to the false ceiling. 

Two of the Silver Succubi are women and one of the Silver Succubi is a man.

Each of the dancers all in variations of the succubus costume.

Each of the dancers are moving with practiced grace to the grinding rhythm of the clockwork band.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:36:01):
The band itself is a marvel of magical engineering.

The band are mechanical figures of various sizes: ranging from the size of a halfling to that of an elf.

Each one is sculpted from brass and copper.

They each play actual instruments with jerky but precise movements. 

A clockwork woman with articulated fingers plays a harpsichord. 

A clockwork man with a bellow for lungs, the man operates a pipe organ.

A clockwork robot shaped to look like a spider-like race (Something with too many arms) handles the percussion.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:37:15):
The music they produce is surprisingly good - a low, sensual rhythm with an underlying mechanical heartbeat:

"Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo! Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:37:21):
"Dit-dit-dit-da, dit-dit-da! Dit-dit-dit-da, da-da-dit-dit-da!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:37:27):
"Um-pa, um-pa, um-pa, um-pa..."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:37:34):
"Doo-doo-doo-doo, DOO-DOO-DOO! (pause) Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-da-doo-da-DIT! Wee-ooo-wuzz-it, wuzz-it-wuzz-it, WAH!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:39:45):
THE CHEST.

IN THE CENTER of the room, on a short raised platform of black marble, sits a massive chest made of silver...
...or at least silver-plated. 

It's wrapped in chains, the chains look more decorative than functional, and each link of the chain is engraved with tiny Infernal script.

Two bare-chested bouncers in exotic foreign garb stand on either side.

These chest-guards wear silk pants, golden sashes, and each of them has a pair of curved scimitars tucked through their waistbands. 

Their muscled arms are crossed over their chests. 

Their expressions say they would very much like someone to try something.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:40:02):
THE CAGE.

Finally, high above the chest, suspended from the ceiling in a brass birdcage, crouches a small creature.

It is bat-winged, pointy-tailed, red-skinned, with eyes like hot coals.

An imp.

A devil.

It notices your group entering and its face splits into a grin full of needle teeth. 

It rattles the bars, spits, and screams something in Infernal that you don't need to speak the language to understand is incredibly vulgar.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:40:43):
Mad Rat mutters: 

"That's Old Scratch. 

He owes Mr. Cyrus a debt. 

Don't ask."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:41:07):
The imp notices your attention and makes an obscene gesture with a clawed hand:

"WELCOME TO DAMNATION, FRESH MEAT!" 

The imp continues to shrieks in heavily accented Common: 

"SPEND FREELY! 

TIP YOUR SERVERS! 

AND REMEMBER... THE HOUSE ALWAYS WINS!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:41:13):
The imp breaks into insane laughter.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:44:37):
One of the servers passes close to your group. 

A Shisk woman with dark skin and silver-painted lips.

She is carrying a tray of drinks that glow with faint blue magic. 

She winks at the group without breaking stride, her coal-black contact lenses giving her gaze an unsettling depth.

The shisk woman places out the tray without a word, clearly intending you all to take one of the blue bombs shots.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:45:17):
Mad Rat looks nervous and says, gritting his teeth:
"Drink."

Mad Rat grabs a blue bomb shot and reaches out to cheers with the party.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:45:21):
Cardigan will take a shot.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 16:49:56):
What do you do?

**Lunnes** (2026-01-22 16:57:28):
No, his instead looks at the band and dancers and his face gains a nostalgic smile, remembering when his sibilins used to bother him to come with they to pubs like this, though far less fancy. He can't help but to think how much they would have loved here

**Lunnes** (2026-01-22 16:58:02):
But he does hear the imp that he decides to ignore

**Aiden101 | Eliora Elf Riddleport** (2026-01-22 22:33:37):
In the bar, an elven woman with pink hair, dressed rather fancily with an overcoat while wearing a monocle and a bandolier of alchemical vials, sits with a cup in hand with an expression of boredom. Without minding her acquaintances sitting next to her, she takes a deep sigh before gulping her drink and putting it back on the table.

But upon hearing the imp, her eyes turn over to the party in curiosity. She watches them from afar in silence, even though it was her break time after yet another mundane job for mr. Cyrus, and as much as she wishes to check the situation herself, since it's not every day that you see such a colorful group roam this estabilishment.

**Lokanadya** (2026-01-22 23:57:03):
At the same table, is a red-haired human. Her face may be familiar to some in the establishment, but not as a customer. 

When she is not working in the shadows for Mr. Cyrus, or helping at her family's much more modest inn some miles away, she does fill some staff shortages once in a while. Whether it be as a game dealer, a barmaid, a cook or scantily dressed hostess.

But tonight was different, she was ominously told to wait in the main room with other agents, and "Enjoy the evening", likely until her services were required.

She is sipping from a glass of red wine, while trying to keep an eye for any unusual signs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 02:12:28):
Ok so

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 02:27:29):
The longer you stand here in the entrance, the more attention you are drawing.

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2026-01-31 02:31:52):
The shot glass was empty before Mad Rat could even finish the explanation, just a blue stain on the fur around her lips.

“Hm? What?”

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-01-31 03:17:31):
Rax considers it for a moment before sighing.

"Can't have him thinking I'm too good to show my true face in his establishment, now can I?"

Reaching up he takes off his hat revealing short, black horns poking out from holes in the top of his mask. He puts the hat under his arm, holding it to his side. Then he unlatches his mask and pulls it off, sliding it over the horns. Under the mask the first thing that catches your attention is an intricately moving set of gears where an eye is supposed to be. While he blinks his good eye the gears click back and forth as it looks like the area where the pupil should be is focusing in and out as he adjusts to the light without the tinted lenses of the mask. He puts the mask under the same arm as his hat and reaches out for the shot glass.

"Cheers"

Rax nods to the rest of the group before downing the mixture and setting the glass back down. He considers putting the mask and hat back on but decides against it, not wanting to disrespect their host in such a way.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 03:23:42):
@MrNegetZ 

Waiting on the professor?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2026-01-31 04:34:26):
*[image]* Will decide to fail against the afliction
This is the Save against adiction

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2026-01-31 04:39:02):
*[image]* (Also the save from my last dose against increasing stage since it has been at least an hour since like you said but not more than 2 so i might've been still affected).

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:10:20):
And no one bats an eye at all.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:10:26):
Several people here smoke flayleaf.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:21:27):
The blue bomb shot hits like lightning wrapped in sea salt.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:22:41):
For a moment, everything sharpens.

The colours are brighter.

The sounds are clearer.

The heat of the braziers is far more intense. 

Your hearts race. 

Your minds are now clear, though perhaps overrunning...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:22:45):
Alert.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:22:49):
Awake.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:22:50):
Ready.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:22:52):
Hyper.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:23:02):
Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:23:07):
This isn't poison.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:23:19):
It's a stimulant.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:23:35):
A Silver Succubi speciality.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:24:42):
Club harder. Dance faster. Gamble with less worry. Fuck longer. Drink without losing yourself.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:25:25):
Mad Rat shudders, shakes his head wildly and bursts out into a big grin, his gold teeth fully on display, his rainbow dreads flapping about.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:25:48):
Mad Rat:
"Woooooow. Now that. That's good shit."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:27:32):
Rax.

You notice Mad Rat looking at you, looking you over.

Mad Rat stares a little at your clockwork eye (now that it is visible).

Mad Rat watches the gears clicking and whirling in the low light. 

Mad Rat notices your small horns poking through your dark fur.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:29:14):
Mad Rat says the following in a way that is meant to sound strategic, but the stim makes his words come tumbling out:
"Bold move. You know, showing your face like that" 

There's clearly respect in Mad Rat's voice. 

Mad Rat continues, talking even faster:
"Mr Cyrus will appreciate that. 

The boss of this place doesn't like people who hide."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:40:32):
A voice cuts through the ambient noise of the casino floor.

Female. 
Exasperated. 
Familiar.

A woman's voice:
"Oh, for fuck's sake."

A half-elven human woman what looks like her thirties (hard to tell with elven blood) pushes through the crowd toward your group. 

The woman is dressed in the Silver Succubi's standard server attire:
The corset.
The bat wings.
The works.

However, this woman wears it with the weary authority of someone who's been doing this job too long to care about looking seductive.
She wears the outfit more like a uniform of office.

The woman's eyes are locked on Moonshine:
"Lenma. 
Fucking.
Moonshine."

The woman stops in front of the cat girl, the woman puts her hands on her hips, and looks Lenma up and down.

The woman looks at the nearly acquired blue stain still on Lenma's fur.

Then the woman's gaze turns to the empty shot glass.

The familiar chaos (follows this particular Amurrun everywhere that Lenma goes) doesn't seem to surprise this woman as much as one might expect.

The woman continues:
"It's been months. 
3 months since I saw you.
3 months without you stumbling through MY doors.
I had began to think to myself, I did."

The woman continues:
"I thought.
That little kitten.
Maybe she finally got on a ship that didn't kick little Moonshine off. 
Maybe she's finally someone else's problem now."

Her expression softens but only just slightly:
"...You look like shit.
You smell like shit."

The woman gives Lenma a genuine look of concern:
"You eating enough? You are too skinny."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:41:16):
The woman finally turns towards the group as a whole.
The woman's voice is far more serious and procedural, as if said 1,000 times before:
"I'm Callie Duskbarrel, head barmaid of the Silver Succubi."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:41:33):
@CapriciousC
How does Moonshine react to seeing Callie, Miss Dusk-Barrel?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:43:53):
Then Callie's eyes drift past Moonshine to the rest of the group.

Past the rat-man with the clockwork eye.

Past the void shell, vampire-like being.

Past the flay-smoking professor.

Past Cardigan and her Eldamon.

To the bound prisoner.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:44:37):
Callie Dusk-Barrel suddenly drops the tough act, turning quite pale:
"Moonshine. Lenma."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:49:30):
Callie Dusk-Barrel:
"I heard someone had got him.
Kreun.
The would-be Crime-Lord."

Callie says under her breath:
"..... Scarlet  ....."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:50:22):
Callie Dusk-Barrel looks at the group and says in a very vague tone:

"What have you done."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:50:27):
It's not a question.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:50:33):
It's said more in disbelief.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:50:57):
Callie seems: impressed, scared, uncertain and quite a few more emotions.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:59:30):
The servers also look over also.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 06:59:41):
@Aiden101 @Lokanadya 

Your characters see what's happening. 

What do they do?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 07:12:10):
@Nemesiux 
@MrNegetZ 

You feel the power of the Rune Wheel's connection spike for a moment: give me an arcana check.

**Aiden101 | Eliora Elf Riddleport** (2026-01-31 16:03:50):
The elven woman watches them all even more surprised, seeing Kreun, the very target of her former investigation, in their clutches. She immediately got off her seat and approached the group with a smile.

"You've actually managed to catch Beltias Kreun?" She speaks as she watches each one of them carefully, almost as if she were quickly analyzing them, before excitedly shouting in a manner that betrays her refined look. "That. Is. Amazing! I have to know the whole story!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 16:12:22):
Cardigan makes finger guns and pretends to DISINTEGRATE the group, making soft "phew phew" sounds.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-31 16:51:10):
DC 20:

Necrila.

You can feel it now. 

A table. 

A woman behind a book. 

You see her across the room.

She hasn't looked up.

She hasn't acknowledged the party, hasn't acknowledged you...but the Rune-Wheel knows her. 

Selenor knows her.

...Or perhaps, will know her one day...

**Lunnes** (2026-01-31 19:29:55):
Gobu decides to go for a walk on the pup after getting tired of hanging in the bar's balcane

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-01-31 19:31:43):
"Even if I choose to believe what you say, I don't think an open casino floor with people watching and..." 

Rax nods up at the ceiling where it was obviously implied there was some form of spying apparatus exists.

"...'people watching' is the best place for such a conversation."

**Lunnes** (2026-01-31 19:43:00):
Gobu walks between the people trying not to get steped on, he looks around the pub imagining how his sibilings would cause trouble and get they kicked out of there. "Giba would try to pole dance in the stage for sure and Gogo would try to flirt with the dancers and get her ass kicked" he thinks while letting a giggle scape. every thing goes well until he senses a putred smell

**Lunnes** (2026-01-31 19:44:11):
"HOLY SMOKES! What is this....." and the he sees Necrila "HOLY MOLY, THE ANGEL OF DEATH?!"
