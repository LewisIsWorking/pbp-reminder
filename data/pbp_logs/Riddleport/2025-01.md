**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-04 07:32:04):
Cardigan Green appears next to you all.

She is a raw bubble of green light.

You see a gnome with wild green hair and a nervous wide smile from within the light.

Cardigan speaks with an echoing voice that speaks with wisdom and power far beyond what you have known of her:

"I am here.
In Riddleport.
A newborn child.

I sense myself as I sense Boggly, 1 half of a single whole.

My draconic powers were taken of me but the seed of the dragon exists here, in this bubble of time.

I am Cardigan Green.
I am the dragon.

I reach out with my hand, across space, this time.

And I make myself as I should be."

The green light seems almost solid as if Cardigan has formed an egg of bio-energy magic around herself.

Cardigan speaks, in pain:
"I am. I was not strong enough, there was and is not enough magic in my child form to inhabit my full manifestation.

Then I shall be as much as I shall be."

Cardigan becomes a dragon gnome.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-04 07:33:15):
As Cardigan stands spectral planets and asteroids float around Cardigan's head, as if Cardigan was the Sun of her own mini solar system.

Cardigan giggles and pokes them, they gently float out of her gravitation pull then slowly return to floating around Cardigan.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-04 08:00:24):
Cardigan sits in the shit, the power dispelled:
"Well, that was weird.
I like my little planets though, pretty cute."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-04 08:00:40):
Cardigan continues:
"This sewer feels....familiar."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-04 09:32:57):
## Session 230. 2024 December 29th Sunday + 4710 AR, 28th Arodus. + Osiria ritual part 2.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-04 17:51:28):
Sinhow stands up. They take a second to adjust to the darkness after the brightness that Cardigan was. His leaves and branches and twigs furl and shake out any dirt that has tried to make it's home there. He squints in the darkness before giving out a horse 

"Anybody have any lights? It's dark as shit in here. Smells worse too."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-04 18:04:17):
Sinhow speaks in a now muffled voice, but stays awkwardly still 
"Okay Cardigan thats nice. Do you remember how to get out of here? Necrilla, Filiuar, some help please?" 

@Nemesiux @MrNegetZ

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-04 18:13:46):
Necrila finds herself in a strange place covered in a weird brown substance that smells terrible.
Thanks to her darkvision, she scans the environment until she notices two small creatures and one medium-sized creature. A voice in her mind informs her that they are a leshy, a gnome, and a human.

She approaches the group and says:
"Greetings.
You are correct; this unit's name is Necrila.
Are you Cardigan?
Where are we?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-04 18:13:55):
*[image]*

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-04 18:22:08):
Sinhow, still muffled,
"Cardigan said these are the riddleport sewers, although she seems preoccupied right now. Does your unit have any memories on this place? Perhaps your unit has a way to detach Cardigan from me?"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-04 18:35:40):
Sinhow, hearing somehow sensing Nercilla's sadness, pushes away from Cardigan. 

"Something that will never be? How do you mean?"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-04 18:44:45):
"Family? Could you elaborate please?" 

Sinhow is still trying to detach from Cardigan, but she seems to have newfound strength with the second hug

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-04 18:51:11):
"We are meant to represent what our creators desired

I am what he desired"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-04 19:43:39):
"Well. I dont know much about voidshells, but I know that people do the same as you do. They are born in the dirt, and they kind of return to nothing when they die. Back to the dirt. Sure they have a soul, and their souls do weird things when they die, but their soul isn't what makes them, well, people. Yaknow? Sure, your existence is temporary, but doesn't that mean you have to be sad about it."
Sinhow takes a second, and attempts to change course. fearful that he may have lost their audience
 "Regardless there's things to do, things to happen. Does your unit have any way of navigating underground easily? Cardigan sounds hungry and Salvation sounds good."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-04 21:05:22):
"Very well. Cardigan! Lead the way out of this sewer please."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-04 23:51:29):

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-05 00:26:26):
Sinhow uses Arcane Sense to cast detect magic. Anything come up?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-05 02:00:36):
*[image]* Through a combined effort two of Cardigan's Eldamon bring you above ground.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-05 02:02:15):
While you come above ground it is early morning, Cardigan says:
"Wait here 2 seconds."

Returning 10 minutes later Cardigan has spent 10 GP of her 15 GP on a map...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-05 02:02:16):

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-05 02:04:36):
"Are maps edible?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-05 02:05:33):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-05 02:06:00):
The map covers itself in coloured auras, with a legend of the most famous buildings listed at the bottom of the map.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-05 02:06:21):
This map gives you a +1 item bonus to Survival checks and any skill checks to Recall Knowledge, 
provided the checks are related to the location detailed on the map.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-05 02:07:11):
You are in an alleyway from where you left the sewer.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-05 02:07:19):
"Ok. You said you were hungry. Let's go somewhere to get you food"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-05 02:07:19):
You are between two tall apartment buildings.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-05 02:07:26):
All around are more apartment buildings.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-05 02:07:53):
Cardigan points at the map and using your knowledge of the lore of Riddleport says:
"We are HERE. The Leeward District."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-05 02:08:46):
As you lot are discussing this several prostitutes of various races walk past the alleyway entrance.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-05 02:09:01):
"I go where you go"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-05 04:52:06):
At the end of the street are 3 buildings:
- Wainwright. It looks to sell wagons, carts and other vehicles. Some of the vehicles look very technologically advanced, if a bit experimental and not fully finished.
- A bakery that's open, it looks to be struggling with broken windows and dirty floorboards.

And sitting between those buildings are a church of Sarenrae. 

The Goddess of the sun's symbology stands above the wide double doored entrance.

The building may have once been lovingly made but it is in serious disrepair.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-05 04:55:02):
The walls that look to have once been white are black with grim and mud.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-05 04:56:07):
The walls are cracked, riddled with holes that have been filled in with bits of rubbish and low quality concrete.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-05 09:28:10):
"It looks abandoned...."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-05 09:56:32):
"Ah that just adds to the flavour Necrilla! Lets get some bread." 

Sinhow brushes past the group and goes into the Bakery.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-05 09:56:47):
What kind of selection do they have?

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-05 10:07:17):
"I would argue that decay is the opposite of stagnation. Decay is vital in an ecosystem"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-05 10:11:19):
"I have no idea what that means Necrilla." Sinhow looks for a baker, and asks the youngest looking one there 

"Hello my good provider, what manner of breads and pastries do you have out for us?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-05 10:13:09):
Cardigan looks sad at the state of the church.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-05 10:40:43):
Cardigan continues:

"It used to be bigger!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-05 22:21:23):
Bakery.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-06 03:40:34):
The party leaves the bakery with their loaf of fancy bread.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-06 11:27:07):
Sibhow leads the party to the church, but asks Cardigan before we arrive 

"Cardigan, do you remember any back entrances to this church? Or some hidden secrets we should know about?"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-07 14:38:46):
What happens next :)

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-08 16:31:24):
What happens next :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-09 04:25:46):
The iron gate is only about 2 metres tall.

It does in fact look to be unlocked.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-09 04:26:08):
The connected fencing is rusted and filled with gaps along its length.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-09 04:27:19):
As you follow look at the gap between the fence and the church on your side, the side of the baker, you see a large oak tree, proud and ancient.
A sign of life amongst the decay.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-09 04:28:42):
Cardigan comments:
"I climbed that tree with Boggly when we played with the orphan children.
They loved playing with us since we were our height and we had a bit of magic.

The weird holes made for good footholds.
Made it easy for Boggly to climb, he was never good at climbing."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-09 16:17:45):
"The top of a that tree might be a good place to ambush the bandits from." Sinhow comments as he walks to the church. He gets to the door and knocks on it.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-09 16:19:31):
Necrila looks at Cardigan as if she is expecting a order "Should I switch to combat mode Cardigan?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-09 16:26:31):
"Should I knock on the door? 
I am aware that it is a mortal polite ritual before entering someone dwelling"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-09 16:27:04):
(Necrilla says, as Sinhow is already knocking on the door to the church)

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-09 16:41:14):
Sinhow watches Filiaur walk into the church, and lowly speaks to the people left outside with a shake to his leafy head
"She's so rude, isn't she? What if they're in the middle of a service?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-09 17:31:18):
Necrila then proceeds to form an X with her hands (just like Cardinal when he saluts people) " I am Necrila daughter of the Chronicler.... Please Saraenrae owner of this church hear my prayer of a peaceful intent for I simply wish to help Cardigan find your priest so that she may eat soup" Necrila says the prayer in Necril

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-13 01:26:24):
You knock on the door of the church of Sarenrae.

The doors are covered in graffiti.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-13 01:28:30):
There is an old wooden fold out sign that says:
"Poorhouse: upstairs & take a left HIKE."

The word "left" scrawled through.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-13 01:28:55):
There is a newer parchment pinned to the door:
"All rooms taken. Fuck off."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-13 01:29:41):
And Filiaur, you attempt to open the door.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-13 01:29:49):
But the door is well locked.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-13 01:34:27):
You hear the door unlock.

An elderly cat folk opens the door just enough for one half of her wrinkled dark (but graying) furry face to glare out at the group:
"WHAT DO YOU LOT WANT?"

She yells in a shriek voice.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-13 01:34:40):
What happens next?
:)

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-14 14:44:06):
What happens next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-14 17:37:59):
The old catwoman continues:
"And there ain't no old man and there ain't no soup."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-14 17:44:27):
Necrila looks confused at Cardigan "Cardigan?"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-15 12:43:20):
Sinhow speaks up, brushing past Cardigan's whisper. 

 "So the charity here is closed down permanently or do you fine folk just have no more room?"

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-01-15 12:50:38):
Filiaur will try to check if this catfolk is some sort of priest of Sarenrae either by checking their attire for a holy symbol or something(if they can see it) or if she can't she will sense motive on what they are saying/about to say(tell me if i do perception or religion).

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-15 13:06:59):
The catfolk continues:
"We live in strange times, look gotta at the SPLOT to tell that much."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-15 13:44:09):
The old catfolk says:
"My name is Caroline.
Are you all looking for a bit of work?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-15 13:52:31):
Caroline:
"The old man is busy dealing with....the less fortune."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-15 13:57:53):
She continues:
"Follow me."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-15 13:59:09):
Caroline points at the double doors then goes up the southern staircase.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-15 14:02:40):
"I, for one, would love to hear what the loonies have heard about these bandits. What say you, Nercil?" 
Sinhow speaks in a quiet voice, but not as quiet as Cardigan was previously. 
"Cardigan keep an eye out for anyone you may recognize from your early years. They may come in handy soon"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-15 14:03:18):
Do the group proceed to the hall?

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-15 14:04:24):
(@Nemesiux anything to say before we meet the loonies?)

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-15 14:09:18):
Sinhow will walk to the door and open it, taking a quick count of the people in the room, and trying to get a good look to see if any have weapons.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-15 15:31:38):
Mostly cluttered around the edges along the hall.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-15 15:32:10):
They are sick, starved and dirty.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-17 15:18:01):
(how many are armed, if any)

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-17 20:28:02):
Sinhow will walk nearby to anyone having a conversation, and attempt to listen in.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-21 08:51:09):
A shadow-flesh little girl, no older than 10 looks at you from about 5 metres away with empty, soulless eyes.

He pale white flesh contrasts sharply with her pitch black eyes and hair.

Her ragged dirty pink dress is not what draws your attention, instead you find your eyes looking at her strange teddy bear.

@Mossssssssssssssssssssssssss 

Roll perception.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-24 13:24:25):
@Mossssssssssssssssssssssssss 

Roll perception.

With your clued in +1 :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-24 14:35:08):
Anyone wish to do anything else in the meantime?

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-24 14:56:09):
Necrla ll try to find people like her among the crowd

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-24 15:15:50):
Necrila does a short greeting bow and then says: "Our void kind desire to exist is not a sin, but causing harm to one another can be. Are you part of the priesthood?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-24 16:11:38):
Necrila will do a sense purpose and illusion

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-25 14:14:40):
Necrila looks a bit confused "But spiritual healing would imply that I am hurt or broken"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-25 17:51:39):
"What wound?"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-01-28 14:06:02):
What happens next :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-29 22:55:06):
The centre of the room is an old stone well.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-29 22:56:32):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-29 22:57:01):
Mika the Redeemer:
"A blood sacrifice.

Let the evil flow out of you, and into purity itself."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-29 22:57:07):
Necrila.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-29 22:58:18):
The well offers power, old magic.

It tempts you greatly.

As this temptation seeps into your mind you feel the warmth of the sun pierce through the clouds.
The light is with you, watching. Not wanting this to happen.

This may be a crucial decision.

What do you choose?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-30 05:04:56):
He pulls out a razor sharp serrated dagger and charges at you.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-30 05:04:58):
COMBAT.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-30 05:05:00):
What do you do?
