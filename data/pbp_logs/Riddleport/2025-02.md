Yee

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-08 20:29:23):
Mika's red glowing eyes stop glowing.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-08 20:29:43):
His stomach rips open from the wounds you put upon his stomach.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-08 20:29:57):
You didn't realise until this second, and neither did he, you landed a CRITICAL HIT!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-08 20:31:08):
Could you roll new damage?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-08 20:33:39):
Total of 14?

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-02-08 20:33:46):
yeah

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-08 20:34:26):
Mika the Redeemer stumbles backwards to the well, his innards slipping out, he is stumbling dead.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-08 20:34:30):
He falls backwards into the well.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-08 20:35:23):
The well's water turns to blood, Mika's body immediately dissolves into purely blood.

No skin, no bones, no sack, no remnants of him remain.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-14 00:03:21):
What happens next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-14 00:03:24):
@Nemesiux

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-02-14 19:16:53):
"Is it a spirit? a ghost? I've always had a connection to them. Strange noises though" Sinhow wants to inspect the bear further, but instead takes a better look at the girl.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-02-15 08:56:19):
(her eyes, right?) Would this be an occultism check at this point? Is she doing any weird casting things?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-02-15 09:43:07):
Am I also seeing something weird?
As I literally clued him in?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-17 12:13:13):
@MrNegetZ 

Would you like to go through the doors into the inner chapel?

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-02-17 20:02:52):
"Perhaps a lie, perhaps a truth yet to be. I work for me and my own, perhaps others too, those that may allow me and mine to survive what is yet to pass. You are a watcher, yet you meddle. Will your meddling help me endure?" 

Sinhows voice goes lower still, and he speaks like he's trying to avoid being overheard.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-02-17 20:26:04):
Sinhow hears this and their leafy face goes flat. He smiles a little and stands straighter. 
"Keep watching, little one, hopefully someone will save you"
 and Sinhow walks away shaking his head. He follows the as they make their way to the inner chapel.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-02-17 21:30:50):
Sinhow will come up close behind the professor, and whisper to her 
"We must watch our path. Not every step is our own"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-17 21:56:04):

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-02-17 22:17:04):
"Lets find Necrilla. She walked off somewhere with an old priest. She might have found out more. I think she went to the roof?"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-02-17 22:20:35):
"Necrilla first. And where did Cardigan run off to? We don't want to split up here."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-02-17 22:20:58):
He looks around for the fourth companion, who led us to this church.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-02-18 06:39:39):
Necrila immediatly drags it into the sunlight

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-18 07:02:06):
Though you have banished one of these vestiges of this THING, 
you are aware that other troughs exist, 
whatever is clinging on is still clinging on, and you just HURT it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-18 07:02:15):
The little building turns to ash.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-18 07:02:25):
There is nothing left on the roof.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-18 07:02:50):
You are left with one thought:
"......did that entity feed on Mika?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-18 07:03:13):
And as soon as the thought comes you hear a woman giggle lightly for less than 1 second.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-18 07:03:18):
Then silence.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-18 07:03:25):
Just the riddleport sky line.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-18 07:03:33):
The sound of seagulls and the wind.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-18 07:03:43):
That's it, it was probably just the wind...right?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-18 07:04:49):
@Nemesiux +1 Hero Point.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-18 07:04:56):
What happens next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-18 07:05:18):
@Nemesiux 

The sun feels warm and comforting as you stand upon the roof.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-02-18 07:44:04):
Necrila approaches the little sun and says "Because you granted my group shelter, I saved  your building from the runelords.
 I hope that this gesture will convince you and your followers to help my father slow down the end times....."
Necrila turns to the pile of dust
"Your sin empire used our knowledge to empower themselves.
My father will find you Sorshen and he will collect the debt your people own his familly"
Necrila does a primal void roar in triumph and now she waits for the sun response

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-02-18 08:25:45):
Necrila stares a bit more at the sun and then enters back in the building

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-02-19 15:19:42):
"Cardigan?" Sinhow looks around for cardigan

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-02-21 11:38:52):
Sinhow takes a long look at her to see if he notices anything different about her. (I'll do a perception check when I get home) 
He gives her a delicate smile and asks
"Cardigan, did you find anything out about this church or what is happening in town?"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-02-22 20:50:50):
*[image]* Perception check

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-02-22 22:46:44):
"Right, lets find Necrilla" and Sinhow will go up the ladder

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-02-22 22:49:16):
No walkway?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-22 22:50:47):
Is everyone on the roof?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-22 22:51:06):
I assume everyone wants to go into the inner chapel?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-22 22:52:48):
You push open the rotting graffitied wooden doors.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-22 22:53:04):
Inside is a beautiful stone room with several flaming braziers.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-02-22 22:54:15):
Any people? Alters? Places of interest other than the flaming braziers?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-22 22:54:19):
In the centre of the room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-22 22:54:32):
( shitting, one second )

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-26 03:55:28):
Inside is a beautiful stone room with several flaming braziers. The circular chamber opens before you, its walls crafted from dark slate and granite typical of Riddleport architecture, with veins of silvery ore running through the stone that catch and reflect the dancing flames. The braziers are positioned in carefully carved alcoves around the perimeter, though you notice that several are unlit, their metal fixtures tarnished with neglect.

At the center of the room stands a life-sized statue of Sarenrae carved from pale granite. The Dawnflower is depicted with outstretched arms, her face turned upward toward the circular opening in the ceiling, though the statue's features have weathered considerably. What once must have been detailed feathered wings extending from her back now appear chipped and broken in places. A thin layer of dust covers portions of the statue, and one hand is missing several fingers.

The shaft of natural light that should illuminate the statue fully seems partially obstructed by debris that has collected around the ceiling's oculus, casting a diminished, uneven light across the chamber. The golden sun disk that would normally adorn the goddess's chest appears dull and tarnished, with several of its decorative rays missing entirely.

The walls still bear intricate relief carvings depicting Sarenrae's compassion, but many sections have cracked over time, with no evidence of repair. Water stains streak down from the ceiling in several places, and small piles of stone chips lie uncollected in corners of the room.

Your footsteps echo as you move across a floor once intricately designed with channels meant to direct light in patterns, now partially filled with dust and debris. Several floor tiles are cracked or missing altogether, leaving uneven footing in places.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-26 03:55:29):
Near the statue, an altar that should hold offerings appears largely bare aside from a single, half-burned candle and what seems to be a forgotten wine cup, tucked partially behind the statue's base. The air carries a mixture of incense and something sharper—perhaps spilled alcohol—rather than the pure, herbal scents one might expect.

Despite its clear state of decline, something of the shrine's original serenity persists—a ghost of its former glory that stands in stark contrast to the lawless nature of Riddleport beyond its walls. The space gives the impression of a sanctuary once cherished but now falling into disrepair, its caretaker's attention clearly divided or diminished.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-26 03:57:24):
A bald headed male priest with a red nose sits in prayer with several children and a few adults, each face looking at the priest to hold a grim tale of abuse and hardship.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-26 04:02:33):
Near the priest is a handsome acolyte, a cleric in training.

He looks to be in his early 20s.

He has somewhat long black hair.

His black eyes dart over to the group as you open the door.

He seemed to be assisting the prayer session but now his gaze locks upon the group.

His robes are different from the priest's robes.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-26 04:04:46):
The priest's robes are a dark orange muddied to a brown with no adornments whilst the acolyte's robes are a brighter hue like a dark amber and he actively wears a shash with the symbol of the sun as well as a pair of frayed surgical clothes poking out of his pockets.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-26 04:06:50):
The acolyte takes a moment before speaking in which time the priest, not paying much attention beats him to the first words:
"Come, join our... Uh... Prayers. Just talking about the, uh, light of the sun and..." 
The priest burps quietly:
"And....so on."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-26 04:07:38):
The acolyte looks sad at the priest and says:
"Yes, come aboard, how rude of me to not say quicker."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-26 04:09:40):
The priest says:
"Brother Jhonas, 
Help them find a seat here next to us, next to the statue."

The word statue is not said properly, bulging and bubbling as he says it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-26 04:10:47):
The acolyte says as he moves across the room to move a brazier a little further away to provide more room for the group to sit:
"Just be careful not to trip on a tile, some are missing."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-26 04:10:52):
What happens next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-27 13:42:27):
What happens next? :)

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-02-27 14:08:36):
Necrila rejoins the group and says to Cardigan in necril "Threat neutralized. You are save now"
