**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-03 02:42:48):
30 minutes pass.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-03 02:42:51):
18 HP healed.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-03 02:43:05):
Cardigan wipes her forehead and says:
"Damn, this is so much harder than in real life...."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-03 02:43:43):
10 more minutes pass.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-03 02:43:53):
Mad Rat keeps an eye out for trouble...all seems fine.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-03 02:44:28):
Though 40 minutes is a while, it is still only the afternoon.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-03 18:57:09):
While Cardigan is healing herself and the party, sinhow will try to calm his breathing, and focus on the moment like he was thought by his instructors. He slowly, and calmly repeats "Fast as the wind, Calculated as the snail" (Sinhow refocuses, twice if he has time)

"Cardigan, I still have a heal spell ready to go if you'd like that. I was saving it for an emergency but shock and awe might be more important there. Mad rat, how many are left?"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-03 19:02:27):
"Is it Beltias in the bell tower and the blind Pidge?" Sinhow's branches betray his thoughts, half of them trying to squeeze in and keep safe, half of them wild and bushy, ready for a fight

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-03 19:45:31):
Yaseitori dusts himself off and wipes the blood off of his beak and talons. 
"Are you guys alright?" The tengu says, stretching his limbs. 
"I saw you fighting and thought you could use some help."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-03 19:46:19):
Sinhow's branches suddenly synchronize in surprise "Oh right. How did you get into the church? Thanks for helping out though, I'm Sinhow"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-03 19:59:50):
"I'm Yaseitori, but you can call me Yasei. I had a necklace stolen that a good old friend of mine gave me. I tracked it to be here, so I hoped to find it here somewhere."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-03 20:09:29):
"Ah well, I hope you have more fight left in you. Mad rat here was just about to tell us who was left of the gang." Sinhow points his rapier harmlessly towards the colourful pirate 
"We've killed a good few of them already, but there's more for sure. Hopefully you find the necklace somewhere along these vagrants."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-05 02:00:19):
Mad Rat:
"There's a few left, yeah."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-05 02:04:18):
Mad Rat:
"There's still the leader.

Mumsy Garrison, technically.
We've killed Knuckles and Fetch.
We killed Balston.
Geezer Pidge is alive, the old man is deadly.
We killed Garspheal Elstrice and Brandy Nurrus.
And we just killed Rasper Ellias and Badeye Rumblefist.

So....

Geezer Pidge and the man himself..."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-05 02:05:37):
Mad Rat:
"Are we going straight up the bell tower then?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-05 02:05:59):
Mad Rat says softly, a bit of excitement in his voice:
"Beltias Kreun...."

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-05 20:09:34):
After having recovered, Filiaur proposes a plan:
"I think We should deal with Pidge now. If we don't we risk him getting called to by Beltias. He is blind so maybe Mad Rat can distract him by talking while we get close to him. Once we're close enough he should be easy to deal with no matter what rank of spells he can cast as long as our new comrade Yasekitori grabs his hands to disrupt his spellcasting."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-05 20:16:36):
Yaseitori nods. "You know these people? What's your deal with them?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-07-05 20:39:18):
Necrila "you are not funny. These are evil people who I reward in kind by beheading them and feeding on their corpses!" She says that while munching on one of the dead guys' arms

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-05 20:41:28):
Sinhow cringes at this, his branches twisting in disgust 
"They're a bit strange I know, but I promise they mean good. I was hoping to find another normal person to help reel them in. Will you help Yaseitori, or is it too much for you?"

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-05 20:43:11):
Adjusting her glasses, Filiaur shrughs
" Everyone has a different way to see things"
At Sinhow's remark she responds a little bit upset
"I consider myself pretty normal compared to that murderous thing over there *she points at necrilla* or you."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-05 20:43:24):
"I've seen worse happening to bodies during my time in the arena. But yes,  can help."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-05 20:45:23):
Sinhow ignores Filiaur, and holds his hand out to the newcomer seeking a necklace. "Excellent to hear Yaseitori, I'm Sinhow. The messy eater is Necrilla. The Haughty Professor is Filiaur. The lady who's a bit too friendly with Eldamon is called Cardigan." 
as he nudges his Rapier in the direction of each member.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-05 20:50:19):
"That being said, I don't hate the Professors idea. Do you feel up to the task, Yaseitori?" Sinhow grabs a piece of cloth, and slowly polishes his rapier

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-07-05 20:53:56):
"Unlike my father I have no patience for 'second chances' or 'redemption', if they are evil then they are food to me"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-05 21:04:19):
"Yes yes, your father is known for never wasting time. Now, shall we fight this old man then?" Some of Sinhows branches are getting starting to twitch

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-05 21:25:00):
"Alright, unless Necrilla has more bones to chew on, lead the way Mad Rat. Occupy Pidge while Yaseitori and I gets into position"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-06 17:33:44):
Yaseitori turns towards Cardigan and looks at her closely, his amber gaze almost piercing. 
"Y-you do seem familiar."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-06 17:41:48):
Cardigan shakes her head:
"Sorry Haku you just seemed...

The form you've taken is the same as my old gladiator teacher."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-06 18:36:32):
"Haiku?" Yasei tilts his head, confused. "I am Yaseitori."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-06 21:35:40):
Mat Rat:
"Also, there's a prisoner in a closet down the hall, want to check that out?
Could be a potential ally?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-06 23:46:27):
What next? :)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-07 01:49:01):
Yaseitori steps back, pressing against a wall, staring at his taloned hands. "I.. I'm not real?" 
Yasei's voice is shaky. "What am I?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 01:53:56):
Cardigan laughs nervously.

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-07-07 02:08:24):
*[image]* "I-I 'on't weaally think, th-therefore I ain', really."

A slurred, raspy voice escapes from down the hall as a cloaked Amurrun wearing a wok over her head stumbles out from around the corner with an unaware chuckle, glancing at the party for a moment.

"Woah are we 'aving a party over 'ere???"

She clears her throat and sniffles for a moment, her nose twitching between the dusting of drunken blush on her cheeks.

"I, uh, I 'unno where I am. Thinkin's hard when, uh— sometimes."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-07 02:16:35):
Yaseitori meanwhile takes a deep breath, trying to regain his bearings. 
A weak pulse of static energy washes over his body, as he begins to meditate and Refocus.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 02:39:23):
Cardigan seems reluctant.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-07 02:39:46):
Filicaer looks at mad rat for a response.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-07 02:52:54):
Seeing an opportunity, Filicaer says:
"About that: 
What if i told you the food could be way better if we cleaned the place ? Are you willing to help us ?"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-07 03:14:31):
"Skin, bone shards and blood for me so far. Not the most nourishing, I must say." 
Yaseitori says, while still leaned against the wall. At least he seems to have found back to himself.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-07 03:33:17):
His voice is more joking however.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-07 16:20:02):
Sinhow sighs seeing the new comer, but quickly gets an idea as a fruit grows from a branch on his forehead. 

"If you want to get paid, maybe the captive down the hall could pay you to free them?"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-08 01:58:22):
*[image]* Silently moving through the upstairs hallways he hears the not-so quiet discussion from a somewhat ajar door ahead. As he gleans the conversation's details he relaxes and continues his approach, still being mindful to not be too loud. As he reaches the door and slips inside he speaks with a slightly muffled voice from within the mask.

"I see I'm not the only one that has business here. Though you might want to keep your voices lower. Nasty individuals have a habit of laying ambushes for those not wary."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-08 02:14:38):
"Huh, this church must be quite an attraction for any wannabe-heroes." Yaseitori chuckles. "Me, the cat and the mockery of a Tengu."
He sighs and steps forward. "I'm Yaseitori, by the way. Yasei if its easier on your tongue."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-08 02:48:56):
He chuckles and withdraws his hand, bowing to you as well. "Been a while since I've dealt with someone from your part of the world. Always forgot the bow. Papa would skin my hide if he saw this interaction."

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-07-08 06:25:30):
Seeing the newcomer in the mask interacting with Cardigan, Moonshine shuffles toward the doctor to give a warning, her fur ironically nearly pressed up against the mask despite her words.

“Careful with that short one, Hushbeak. It gets handsy without asking.”

She squints warily at Cardigan, not discreet whatsoever despite her attempted whisper.

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-07-08 06:54:04):
“One… two…”

Moonshine rubs her eyes with the back of her hands and leans in a bit toward Cardigan, still squinting at her, before backing up a few steps to size her up. She closes the distance again, before looking up at her.

“Where’s the other four feet??”

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-08 07:00:07):
Cardigan:
"It's nice to be a gnome again."

Cardigan smiles widely.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-07-08 10:00:50):
"Why didn't you just murder them all? I thought you worship your destroyer friend"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-08 10:20:34):
"I hate to change the subject, but I came here to smack a gang leader who overplayed their hand."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-08 11:20:48):
"That sounds like a wonderful idea my friend. Last I heard that gang leader was in that room over there. You wanna go first, we'll back you up?" 

Sinhow points to the closet door that Mad Rat mentioned had a captive

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-08 12:06:21):
"Not going to happen. If I was alone or had quieter companions." Rax rather obviously motions at the drunken catfolk as he says that. "But in this line of work you learn pretty quickly that discretion is the only part of valor worth believing in."

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-08 18:31:35):
Filiaur, in complete conrast, just walk up to the room with the prisoner, inspecting the door, she snaps her finger, and her humanoid contruct comes over
"Ok puppet let's see what's behind that door, get it open."
Puppet will open the door, or try to force it open if it's locked.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-08 18:37:14):
Rax just shakes his head and reaches into his bag, pulling out a tiny tengu shaped golem. He whispers to himself and his little familiar. 
"Time to get to work Ruk, stay close." 
He sets the little guy down and draws his sword from his cane and secures the sheathe to his side.

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-07-08 18:51:41):
Seeing the others ready a weapon and open the door just like that, Moonshine grabs onto the wok capped over her head, almost for a sense of security, as her fur stand with alarm.

"Oh, more friends! More friends are good— Wait, what are we—?"

Her grasp on her gourd tightens as the puppet (tries to force?) open the door.

**Kaz Crowe | root // effigy | Riddleport** (2025-07-08 21:51:51):
*[image]* When the door finally came open, the prisoner’s eyes squeezed shut - even dim, it was more light than she’d had in there. When she managed to peek them open again and look up, well… she looked confused, to say the least; these weren’t her captors, that was for sure, and she wasn’t sure if that was for better or for worse.

Her restraints were light but thorough; metal shackles binding her wrists behind her, a bit of rope gagging her, a bit of rope tying her ankles together. From the bit of blood on her heel and a few corresponding drops of once-crimson-now-rot-brown on the floor not too far away, it looked like the rope on her ankles was a last minute  preventative measure to keep her from blacking someone’s eye with her boot. The rope gag seemed to have more point than just silence, too - the fibers were singed black at the edges of her lips, like she had went as far as spitting fire, somehow.

**Kaz Crowe | root // effigy | Riddleport** (2025-07-08 21:51:59):
She was a woman of Tien descent, she definitely looked like a pirate, from her dress, though the trademark hat one might have expected a pirate to wear was not a part of her ensemble, and her hair was somewhat a mess as it cascaded down her back and over her shoulders, flakes of fine ash clinging to the once-silken mess.

( i didn't break the char limit you broke the char limit )

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-08 21:55:34):
Sinhow will reach in and lower the gag and raise his rapier. 

"Why are you here and tied up, and do you have any moral or philosophical objections to killing or maiming blind old men?"

**Kaz Crowe | root // effigy | Riddleport** (2025-07-08 21:58:14):
She coughs - a small cloud of ash, at that - and exhales a 'finally,' in Tien, before meeting Sinhow's eyes. "Not a single qualm in the world," she said, keeping a leash on the heat of her anger. "—Who *are* you?" she glances at them.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-08 22:02:01):
Yaseitori's ears perk up at the sound of Tien words. Well they would, had Yaseitori any ears.
He has, but not like the outer part. 
He replies in Tien: "From what it looks like, we are here to clean up this church."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-08 22:04:01):
Sinhow nods his head, and kind of looks behind him. He starts a tally as some branches on his shoulder perk up to keep count. 
"We're a group of 9 people, a puppet and a uhhhh" his voice breaks when he notices what is around Rax 
"A crow? Trying to fight an old blind man." 
Sinhow will start cutting through the rope restraints, and in a stage whisper call out 
"Anyone know how to pick locks?"

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-07-08 22:34:12):
Moonshine looks down at the handcuffs and blinks for a moment before realization strikes her.

“Oh, yeah! I’ll get those for you!”

She lifts her cloak to the side to reveal a set of covert instruments strapped to her belt, fumbling with them between her fingers in a drunken stupor. Finally picking a couple out, she lifts them up before her eyes with excitement.

“These should do the—“

However, with her impaired motor control and eager excitement at the familiar face, upon lifting the picks to eye level to inspect them, the clumsy Amurrun smashes the picks into the underside of the wok capped over her head where they fly out of her fingers upon impact.

“Oops!”

She leans over to pick them back up, but just as her hands reach for the pick, the steel wok slides off her head and lands convex side down directly onto the delicate picks with a clang. She stares down at the crushed picks and reverberating wok in silence.

“Oh…” Another flash of eager realization crosses her features. “Wait! Tha’s why papa always says to ‘ave backups!”

The catgirl pats herself down under her cloak before producing a few extra picks from her belt pouch and properly gets to work at the shackles this time.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-09 03:21:14):
Rax steps forward after they finish freeing the captive from her restraints, sheathing his sword.
"Let me take a quick look, make sure there are no lingering injuries from your capture and time restrained. Though it seems at the moment the ones foolish enough to be at your feet got the worst of it. I hope the bastard ended up with a broken jaw."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-09 05:16:21):
Sinhow looks around at the group. A violent man eater. A know it all professor. A cat drunkard. A doctor of plagues. Cardigan. Some foolish noble.  A pirate. A bird who lost a necklace. Sinhow closes his eyes and sighs slowly. He remembers his teacher, back in the forest. 'Even a dull blade cuts with the right strike' he sighs again and opens his eyes. He speaks in a hushed voice, loud enough for everyone to listen in. 

"Right, so bandits left. One in the bell tower, one in the library. Pidge is in the library. Mad Rat will go in first, and distract him, hopefully long enough for Necrilla, Yaseitori and I to get close to him. Yaseitori will try to hold him down, Necrilla and I will do violence. The rest of you, try to use the book stacks as cover, and try to stay separate. Spell casters can be tricky, so let's not get caught out. Everyone good to go?"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-09 05:22:53):
Sinhow lets out some air before he speaks. 
"Maybe you just watch the door? Make sure nobody else makes it in after us."

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-09 05:35:40):
Filiaur puts her hand on sinhow's leafy shoulder:
"You have to learn to simplify your plans for the less sharp of mind here instead of trying to push them out. Let me show you"
She walks up to the catfolk and explains the plan using different hand motions in a sort of finger puppet show:
" So:
Two very bad bandits still alive
One is blind old man, but strong Spellcaster
Plan is: 
- Rat *pointing at mad rat* distracts old man with voice
- We sneak close
- Once close enough bird man grab old man to make him stay put.
-The rest put old man to sleep
"

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-07-09 05:43:35):
“Right, right…”

The Amurrun blankly nods along at Sinhow’s simplified instructions.

“I ‘unno if you’ve noticed, but err, I’m not great at being aware of my surroundings…”

She glances over at Filiaur as she approaches, shuffling to her side and nodding along much more intently, her eyes locked onto the finger puppets.

“Mhm, mhm. So we ambush geriatric disabled man… Got it! …and the other bandit?”

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-09 06:09:38):
Rax speaks up as he finishes his examination of the young woman.
"If you give me a moment before you rush in I can probably nail him with a Skunk Bomb. Nasty stuff, don't wanna get caught in it when it lands unless you like puking your guts out. Will definitely make things harder for him and easier for us unless he has an iron stomach."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-09 11:13:55):
Sinhow shakes his head "No no, no bombs. Nothing that could hurt Necrilla and I. We want to go in there and kill him before he realizes we want to, before he can fight back. Save the bomb for when things go bad."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-09 12:39:19):
Rax sighs and starts to raise his gloved paw to the bridge of his face before remembering the mask and lowering his arm.
"Which is why I said I would just need a moment. Hit him with the bomb then immediately after you both charge in while he's still reeling, barely able to keep himself upright and his lunch down. Saving the bombs for when things are going wrong can cause things to spiral even worse if not done exactly right. I know from experience."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-09 14:06:17):
Sinhow looks at him, in defiance first, then calculation. A fruit grows above his forehead as an idea forms. 

"What's the stinking agent in your bombs? If he's blind he'll might be able to sniff us out. Mad Rat could use the smell as part of the distraction, the lie, and it would help us get in position without Pidge noticing." 
Sinhow speaks quickly, almost excited.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 06:14:59):
Caught up.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 06:15:08):
Cardigan sits, waiting patiently.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-11 07:07:00):
"So.." Yaseitori ponders. "What's up with that blind guy you were talking about?"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-11 07:32:36):
"You said, he casts spells. Doubt he can bend a twig though." Yaseitori laughs, but keeps himself from bolstering too much.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 07:39:40):
Mad Rat hesitates....:
"We... we could go around Old Man Pidgeon.
I don't think we can take him."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-11 15:23:05):
Sinhow angles his head, in question. 
"Nine of us, with a solid plan and the element of surprise. Versus one old blind man. Are you scared, Mad Rat, or is that a tactical decision?"

**Kaz Crowe | root // effigy | Riddleport** (2025-07-11 15:57:07):
“I’d take those odds,” Enya said from where she had folded her arms and rested a shoulder on something solid. “We could set him on fire?”

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-11 16:15:18):
Exasperated, Sinhows continues his loud whispers
"You lot-" he stops himself and takes a breath, calming the thorns that his branches turned into. 

" Mad Rat is right." Sinhow says, putting emphasis on the second word. He takes moment to re-asses. 
"Alright then, speak up. Once we kill the man in the bell tower, what do we do with Pidge? Necrilla promised to clear them all out to the Priest."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-12 07:11:37):
Rax looks over the group and then to Mad Rat.
"Sure things might be nice and all, but I also hate leaving myself open to a pincer attack. Especially in mixed company."
He shifts his gaze to the others 
"No offense."

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-07-12 08:14:34):
Still stowing away her covert instruments, Moonshine simply looks around at the party as they discuss plans, clearly not following.

“…so which company do I put down as my employer for jumping the crippled senior on official documents?”

**Kaz Crowe | root // effigy | Riddleport** (2025-07-13 04:23:44):
Enya unfolds her arms briefly, only to hold her hands up slightly. "None taken," she said. "I don't disagree."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-15 06:03:39):
Cardigan:

"So....."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-15 09:39:30):
"Where is that guy?" Yaseitori leans against a wall.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-07-15 16:18:53):
"We have to slaughter them all! Their terrible deaths will serve as a message to the other meat bags of Riddleport. 

Mess with the sun goddess and her servants kindness and you will be confronted with my kind's wrath."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-15 16:27:00):
Rax mutters under his breath, his hand clenched in a fist for several moments before he releases a sigh and starts fiddling with his various elixirs, bombs, and vials to get it ready for the fight ahead.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-15 16:39:27):
"So the plan remains the same? Mad rat talks to Pidge, the rest prep for an ambush? If Mad rat can talk him down, fine, if not, we attack?" Sinhow starts to rotate his rapier in his hand, in anticipation.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-07-15 17:10:26):
Necrila for a second has an eureka and asks Mad Rat "Mad Rat, this pigeon lord is blind and a caster correct?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-07-15 17:10:35):
"What if we cut off his tongue?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-07-15 17:11:27):
"He won't be able to cast spells and we could try to deafen him too!
What if we bring some drums or scraps to throw around to  flood his area with random noises?"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-15 17:12:11):
"See now you're thinking with more than a blade Necrila." Sinhow pats her on the shoulder, and turns to the rest of the group. 

"Anybody got a set of drums on them?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-07-15 18:20:45):
Necrila thinks a bit more "If we don't have any instruments we could ask the priest to start a singing choir or something like that "

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-15 20:59:35):
"Stupid thought, but what if he sees through the eyes of the pigeons? Is that even possible?" 
Yaseitori scratches his beak.

**Kaz Crowe | root // effigy | Riddleport** (2025-07-15 21:01:51):
"In theory, I could try to generate an air current strong enough to have a similar effect," Enya said, thinking about it as the air shifts around her - no longer the scent of the room they were in but of an open field carrying the scent of a faraway wildfire and its ashes on it, though only within their space and only for long enough to demonstrate the air current picking up around them, though she did not disrupt anything with it that might give them away. "...that's assuming he's not on to something about the pigeons, though... if he is, we might still have ways to reduce visibility for him... them?...Him."

( mechanically that's just a brief use of channel elements to bring up the aura. functionally really did not do anything else. )

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-15 22:35:30):
Yaseitori glares back at Necrila. "What did you just call me?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-16 05:53:47):
Mad Rat:
"I'm ready when you are."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-16 06:06:57):
"Ok, no fighting. You can kill each other after we deal with this shit, ok?"

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-07-16 06:10:33):
“…so… after all that yappin’, all I gathered is we’re still ganking the geriatric blind guy.”

Moonshine looks around to verify before raising an eyebrow at Rax, wrinkling her nose at the thought of the Skunk Bomb.

“Are you really a doctor? I thought bombing people with chemical weapons was against the Hippopotamus Oath… Even the medics at duels looked away until after gunshot around here.”

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-16 06:29:12):
"That's the Hippocratic Oath you're thinking of. And yes, I am a doctor. But I also am not a fool. Even before I came to this place I've learned that I can't just expect no one to hurt me just because I'm a doctor. Some people suck and you gotta do what you have to to survive. If it means using bombs, poisons, and weapons then that's what I'm going to do. But I also measure my response in terms of the danger posed. That's why I carry a nightstick as well as a sword. Some drunken fool I'll just knock his ass out. This guy we're getting ready to fight, his boss is threatening people around me. He might not have tried that shit with me or my direct loved ones, but making the area around me unsafe does plenty of harm as it is. And I will fuck his shit up for that."

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-07-16 06:32:47):
Moonshine listens blankly to the explanation, seeming to have only absorbed half of that, but she nods along to the last part with an approving smile.

“You sound like my Mama…”

She pauses to take another swig from her gourd before continuing.

“That’s pretty badass.”

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-16 06:36:54):
Rax chuckles and turns his attention back to the two quarreling 'allies'.

"Speaking of poison, who wants some poison for when they stab Pidge in his unseeing fucking eyes?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-07-16 06:51:11):
Necrila states"Me, me, me!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 13:57:57):
Cardigan and Mad Rat are ready to go.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-17 15:11:25):
Then go? Set the scene infront of the library door, we'll react appropriately

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 15:17:00):
Example:

"I go down the corridor and open the door."

"My character goes down the corridor and opens the door."

"[The character name] goes down the corridor and opens the door."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 15:17:52):
We shall assume the party proceeds down the corridor and opens the door.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-17 15:48:06):
Quietly as they make their way down the corridor, Rax makes his way to Necrila and Sinhow. With practiced ease he slips a vial into Necrila's palm.

"I only have the one vial of poison pre-prepped. Make it count."

He then slides over to Sinhow, similarly slipping a vial and a glass bottle into a pouch and attaching it to their side. "The vial is an Elixir of Life and the bottle is one of my Skunk Bombs. For emergencies."

Before they can fully respond he starts slipping more towards the middle of the crowd, redrawing his sword.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 15:49:53):
Mad Rat turns the door knob and opens the door.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 15:50:10):
The room is cold as one wall is open to the air.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 15:51:18):
The walls are aligned with bird keeping apparatus: 
feeders, 
messaging letter anklets, 
bird cleaning brushes,
Bags of feed, 
Etc.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 15:51:59):
Along the upper edges of the ceiling, going around the entirety of the room, including the open wall is a support beam, and on top of the support beam are hundreds of pigeons.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 15:56:38):
An old man kneels at the edge of the room, just off from the edge of the open wall.

After the open wall is a sudden drop to the ground below.

The only thing preventing someone from walking off the edge is a rotten, gnarled banister, haphazardly crossing the length of the open wall.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 15:57:02):
The cold sea air brushes against you all, a shiver runs down your spine.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 15:57:15):
Mad Rat hesitates.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 15:58:22):
Pidge turns ever so slightly, his back still to the group, you can see a small pigeon with a broken wing in his hand.

A moment later he tosses the baby pigeon 🐦 outwards, into the air.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 15:59:34):
The baby pigeon immediately takes flight, its wing healed.

The pigeon lands on the ground next to two other pigeons, likely its parents, before taking off.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 16:01:23):
Pidge still doesn't turn:
"I recommend that you decide to move along.

... I've fixed enough broken bones today."

Pidge says this with no malice, if anything there is a hint of affection or disassociation in his voice.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 16:01:56):
Whether this affection is for the group, or from watching the pigeon fly away, it is unclear.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 16:03:01):
Mad Rat takes 3 steps back, until he is at the back of the group, his crossbow drawn but not aimed at Pidge, instead his arm hangs by his side, pointing at the ground.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 16:03:20):
Cardigan maintains her position but looks to the group to say something.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-17 16:07:04):
Yaseitori was ready to go into a fighting stance, but after seeing this, how this man takes care of the pigeons, he can't see a reason to kill this guy, right now.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-17 16:10:45):
Yaseitori holds his arm still as the pigeon lands on it. Carefully, he opens the bag and pours a bit into the palm of his hand, taking a closer look at what it consists of before offering it to the same pigeon that brought it to Yasei.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-17 16:22:43):
Intrigued, Yaseitori takes a fingertip full of the feed into his own beak.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-17 16:46:37):
Sinhow whispers to Necrilla. "You can probably push the old man over edge if you rush in quickly. I can ask him if I can borrow some pigeon excrement for fertilizer as a distraction"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-17 16:50:53):
Sinhow whispers to Necrilla again "How the fuck did that old man hear me??"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-17 16:52:20):
"But you still know what we are. Do the pigeons tell?"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-17 20:47:20):
Rax hisses behind his mask, starting to wonder if he should have wasted his only poison vial on someone who is proving to be fucking daff.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-07-17 20:52:06):
"Now, who are you sir? Drop the tough blind guy act you are not being cool"

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-07-17 22:26:12):
Moonshine looks around at the party with a slight confusion as Mad Rat doesn’t follow the plan, leaning over to Filiaur with a tactless whisper that the blind man with heightened hearing can probably still hear.

“Are we doing diplomacy now? I thought we wanted to kill evil bad bandit man. Are we still jumping the blind pigeon geezer?”

Her hands are clenching tightly onto her wok and gourd with defensive alarm, her fur straight and bristled, Ready [a Reaction] to drop into a [Stumbling] stance more suitable for combat at a moment’s [Initiative Roll] notice.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-18 00:28:03):
Yaseitori gets worried about the tensing Situation, while the Birdman does like a good fight, having no prior qualms about this man, he has found sympathy for the blind man, less because he is blind, moreso because Pidge cares for the pigeons so lovely. 

Yaseitori gently pets the pigeon on his arm and feeds it some more feed while stepping forward, standing protectively infront of Pidge. 

"Look.. I don't know what this man supposedly did that he does deserve death. See how well he cares about the pigeons."
He points to the young pigeon that had a broken wing. 
"He is blind, he found it true calling in caring for these little messengers of the sky. Would you take it from him?"
He continues to pet the pigeon while he looks around to maybe find a few of the kind of messages Pidge writes. [Seek]

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-18 00:40:35):
*[image]*

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-19 02:04:14):
Removing her glasses, Filiaur changes tone
"You two are gonna stop bickering really quick."
Adressing pidge she says:
"Ok, maybe we can figure this out. What's your relation with the man at the top."

**Kaz Crowe | root // effigy | Riddleport** (2025-07-19 16:02:20):
"Even monsters have things they care for," Enya said from her place in the doorway as she looked to Yaseitori. "Things they love. While I agree that we should be leaving the birds alone, that doesn't mean anything about him beyond that it's something he cares for."

Enya glanced over to Filaur, giving a small nod in her direction before looking back to Yaseitori. "But she's asking the right question." Where she stood, her hand was resting on the grip of her whip - it almost looked more like she was resting her hand on her hip; more casual, less violent intent.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 08:35:32):
You do notice the pigeons do seem to have a bit of grease on all of them.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-22 08:37:44):
"Why are the pigeons so oily? More than just by preening."
Carefully, he smears a bit of the grease from the pigeon on his arm into his hand, rubs it inbetween his fingers and carefully smells it.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-22 09:18:53):
Yaseitori turns towards Pidge. "Again, with the time stuff. What does that mean?"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-22 19:22:58):
Sinhow chimes in, still whispering "Ask if his rival is a cat caretaker, I've seen a lot of pigeons get eaten by cats"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-07-22 19:28:39):
Necrila says "ahh good one"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 06:49:45):
Pidge stands for the first time and starts emptying bird feeders, cleaning droppings and petting pigeons that land on him.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 16:07:33):
Pidge looks out to the ocean and breathes in the air.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 17:29:07):
Pidge looks up.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 17:29:19):
As if Pidge could sense something happening.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 17:29:24):
Pidge smiles.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 17:29:44):
Pidge looks at Yaseitori:
"Look after them for me."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 17:30:06):
A few pigeons fly into Pidges cloak.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 17:30:21):
Pidge walks towards the open air end of the room and as he does...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 17:30:33):
A gateway appears.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 17:31:03):
A gateway of black dark flesh, it drips slimes and is covered in dozens of eyes and they all stare at Pidge.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 17:32:08):
Pidge walks across the room, looks back at his pigeons, at the party and turns to the gateway:
"Good luck. 
I mean it.
Let's save the world.

I'll see you all in 4719 AR."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 17:32:19):
Pidge walks into the portal ...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 17:37:03):
The room is empty.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-23 18:00:18):
Rax looks between everyone and shakes his head 
"That was odd and anticlimactic."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-07-23 18:04:29):
Necrila responds by saying "Let's go. We have a meat bag to behead"

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-07-23 18:10:15):
“Old cripple flee to pasta dimension? Evil bad meathead bandit kill instead?”

Moonshine looks around, not sure if she’s seeing things after pigeon man left through a time portal.

“Nyanya, you saw that too just now, right? I think I need a drink… Am I still getting paid for this?”

She looks over to Mad Rat for confirmation, and with a heavy sigh, she tilts her gourd over her as the wine leaks out and down into her mouth. She wipes some droplets of the alcohol off the fur around her mouth and looks down at the gourd.

“Or maybe I need to lay off the drink for a while…”

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-23 18:16:12):
"Huh." Yaseitori says. "At least the pigeons are fed for now.." 
He pets the pigeon on his arm. 
"But the other guy is somebody that really should be killed, right?"

Gently, if the pigeon wants, he places it back onto the perch.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-23 18:34:19):
Sinhow throws his hands in his air. 
"One guy distracts the target, the others sneak up on him. How is ANY of that convoluted?"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-23 20:54:05):
"I guess I am the new pigeon keeper now."
Yaseitori chuckles somewhat amused.  
"I'm sorry my feathered friends." I say, gently placing the pigeons back onto the perches. 

"Okay. Well, lets get that behind us."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-23 21:03:26):
We move towards the bell tower. 
"Mad rat, you know of a good way to not get pierced a million times as we climb the stairs to him?"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-24 11:29:07):
"Beltias. In the bell tower. An archer. Arrows. He has the advantage. Anything you can tell us that'll help against that advantage?"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-24 20:46:36):
"No, you only told us he was plotting shit. Why would he be in the bell tower if he's no good with range?"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-24 20:49:22):
"Well I hope momma taught you to climb, cause you're gonna be a predator today"

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-24 21:04:35):
"Bells can also be used to transmit signals to his associates around town"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-24 21:05:35):
"So do we take a walk around the church to see if the zip line is true, or do we just rush him up the stairs?"
