**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-05-01 20:43:16):
Filiaur will message Sinhow:
"How about we wait until the scorpion fight is over?
Once they are distracted with their victory or loss we strike, it'll also be one less scorpion to worry about and the scorpion still standing will be injured."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-05-01 20:45:53):
Does Sinhow need to do a perception check to figure out (roughly) how many scorpions are there in the room?

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-05-03 18:12:53):
Sinhow will reply to the message the professor sent and nod as he does. 

"You lead, I follow. I will wait for you signal"

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-05-03 18:19:39):
We'll just come back latter then/watch the end of the fight?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-03 18:21:08):
Up to yous.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-06 11:13:16):
Both the human and the orc look annoyed by the group standing around.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-06 11:13:42):
Rumble fist:
"I said it already: PISS OFF."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-06 11:14:10):
Rasper:
"Agreed."

And Rasper tried to close the door.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-05-06 11:16:59):
Does the room lead to somewhere or is it a dead end from what I can see?
I'll also ask mad rat this by message.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-07 19:17:25):
The Scorpions, injured, lay on straw beds in the corners of the room.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-05-07 19:58:48):
Necrila growing impatient whispers to the professor" how about we distract their pets with a snack?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-08 09:44:48):
Cardigan whispers:
"Or we just kill them?
We murdered those other guys super easily, no?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-13 01:43:45):
.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-05-18 17:57:54):
The daughter of the Chronicler, with a malicious smile, sings in the language of her people (Necril) before combat, as the heads of her enemies hang from the cloak draped across her back:
"Rip and Tear their bones and blood!

Rip and Tear, fight to the death!

Rip and Tear their bones and blood!

To the death, no surrender!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-25 00:32:29):
COMBAT.
