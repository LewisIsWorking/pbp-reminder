**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-05 22:24:50):
Room 9.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-05 22:25:10):
Does the group go into the hallway to deal with Knuckles Redbone and his dog, fetch?

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-05 22:55:23):
Sinhow's bark and branches contract a little, as if he is tensing. He looks around to his group, and takes out his rapier. 
"Are we ready to do this? Any plan of attack, or do we open up and rush in?" He looks like he's asking for support, or confidence.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-05 23:00:45):
"Necrilla, Professor?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-05 23:09:07):
"I shall collect their heads as a warning to all rude mortals!"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-05 23:15:03):
"Very well Necrilla, I will help you with this. Professor, cover our backs, Cardigan shock them with something big, then Necrilla and I will charge in!" 

Sinhow goes into a fighting stance, activating his Embodiment of battle! And waits for Cardigan to pop off the combat!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-05 23:19:14):
COMBAT.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-05 23:55:42):
Initiative.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-05 23:56:04):
Knuckles Redbone: 11

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-05 23:56:07):
Guard Dog: 24

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-05 23:56:19):
Cardigan: 25.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-05 23:56:22):
PLAYERS GO FIRST!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-05 23:56:27):
Who wants to start?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-05 23:57:15):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-06 00:07:00):
Sinhow strikes Knuckles Redbone for 15 damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-06 00:07:07):
Knuckles Redbone is bleeding heaviy, pierced deeply.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-06 00:08:40):
Necrila goes in for a double slice, the first slice kills Knuckles Redbone dead before the 2nd attack even lands.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-06 00:08:50):
Fetch the dog barks INSANELY.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-04-06 00:14:36):
Filiaur moves behind the dog.
She strikes at the dog, hitting it and engraving a rune of fire on it.
She invokes ATRYL, the rune of fire.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-06 00:18:14):
Knuckles Redbone & Fetch the dog are dead.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-06 00:18:45):
Mad Rat says:
"We had better start going room to room and clearing out this place.

This church is noisy and thick walled but they will be discovered sooner or later."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-06 00:19:30):
"Alright, Necrila hack that head off and lets move on! Good work Cardigan, that was excellent, but maybe listen to the plan?"
 Sinhow collects himself, clears off some blood spatter from his branches, and starts to leave the room

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-06 02:13:05):
Necrila chops off Knuckles head off and adds it to her collection

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-06 12:53:26):
"Right rat man, lets hurry. Who's closest? Rasper and badeye? Lets hurry"
Sinhow speaks in loud whispers. Sinhow is antsy on his branched feet, sustaining his embodiment of battle, urging everyone to hurry.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-06 13:05:46):
"Spellcasters are risky, they can change the playing field with one spell, I'd rather not risk it when others can still ambush us. Lets get someone else"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-06 14:15:18):
"Rat man, whose' the next closest?"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-06 15:24:34):
Sinhow spins around on his heel, the branches around their head bush out, like a cat's fur when they're about to fight. His rapier finds it's place beneath the chin of Mad rat
"Answer the question, or you'll be a head lighter"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-06 16:24:12):
"Point us to the door with Rasper and Rumbefist. I'll run in and try to get their attention focused on me, Necrilla follow up, Professor lay them out and Cardigan clean up? Everyone good with that?" 

Sinhow moves the rapier down, ready to move quickly.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-13 19:56:42):
Mad Rat continues:
"My boss had me read up about this place before going undercover.
Anyways, there's room 7 to 17 we have to think about."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-13 19:57:40):
Mad Rat continues:
"Room 7 is the library, they just keep holy books and Taldan Poetry in there, so unless you fancy stealing those we don't need to think about it."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-13 19:58:03):
Mad Rat continues:
"We've dealt with rooms 8 and 9."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-13 19:58:58):
Mad Rat continues:
"Room 12 is where Brandy Nurrus and Garspheal Elstrice are."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-13 19:59:28):
Mad Rat continues:
"Room 10 is where Old Man Pidge is.
Lets....avoid that room, like we will all die."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-13 20:00:00):
Mad Rat:
"Room 13 is where Badeye Rumblefist and Rasper Ellias is. 

They have a lot of scorpions."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-13 20:01:30):
Mad Rat continues:
"I've never been on the next floor up, so I dunno what's up there.
As for the other rooms, never been in them, too suspicious.

I guess we'll find out as we go through them."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-13 20:04:13):
Necrila smiles "Yee!" then says in necril "Death to the rude mortals!"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-13 20:04:25):
"Alright, Rat, lead the way to room 12. Nercilla go in first, I'll follow. Caster don't let us die" Sinhow is antsy on his feat, ready to fight

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-13 20:06:17):
Sinhow is already leaving as the professor stumbles over the plan

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-13 20:15:28):
Mad Rat points at the door labelled 12.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-13 20:15:45):
Mad Rat:
"The door might be locked."

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-13 20:49:17):
"Go on Professor, pick that lock, lets deal with them"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-13 21:59:41):
A gruff voice yells:
"Who's out there?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-14 00:05:38):
There is a brief bit of arguing.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-14 00:05:43):
Brandy Nurrus opens the door.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-14 00:07:19):
A lean mean looking elf sits in up a small set of stairs at the far end of this room.

That elf is, as you know: Garspheal Elstrice.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-14 00:08:02):
Brandy Nurrus is a tall human with slick sweaty hair and has a doctor's bib on that is smeared with blood.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-14 00:08:14):
There are two mattresses on one side of the bed.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-14 00:08:35):
The other side of the room is a torture chair, many many items for torture and several very fully disguise kits.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-14 00:10:22):
A grotesque arsenal of blood-saturated implements hangs from corroded iron pegs on the discolored wall, each tool meticulously arranged like trophies of unspeakable acts. 

Forceps with tissue still clinging to their rusted jaws neighbor garden shears whose blades bear deep, rust-colored stains that no amount of cleaning could remove.

The chisels' edges, once precise, are now jagged from repeated contact with bone and cartilage. 

A hammer, its metal face pitted with dark matter, rests beside a corkscrew whose spiral bears unmistakable traces of dried viscera.

The barber's straight razor, its edge honed to lethal perfection, gleams with an incongruous brightness amid its grim companions. 

The fireplace poker, bent slightly at its tip, suggests resistance from its previous subjects. 

Three branding irons, their designs obscured by blackened residue, promise permanent marks of ownership. 

Mounted on the adjacent wall hangs a grimy, partially shattered mirror that refuses to reflect clearly, as if bearing witness to too many atrocities to function properly, its fractured surface offering only distorted glimpses of what stands before it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-14 00:10:57):
Brandy Nurrus looks at you all, visibly grows more suspicious, sees Mad Rat and says:
"HUH? What's going on here?
You lot ain't cleaners!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-14 00:44:28):
Garspheal Elstrice lowers his bow.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-14 00:44:35):
Both are very curious.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-14 16:39:14):
Sinhow is antsy on his feet, wondering where the professor is going with this.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-04-14 16:45:14):
Filiaur will message Mad rat secretly(using the spell):
"What's up the stairs?"

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-04-14 20:00:53):
Her construct companion slowly approaches the bowman on the stairs.
She'll say:
"Oh it seems it found some shit over there"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-14 23:36:12):
Mad Rat continues:
"...and from what I've hear, his personal stash...."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-15 01:41:26):
Necrila throws the bandits' fallen comrades heads at them and says " you are next!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-17 21:11:08):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-17 21:11:16):
Allisee wins initiative.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-17 21:11:22):
With 21 init.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-17 21:11:26):
Players go first.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-17 21:11:41):
@MrNegetZ

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-17 21:11:44):
Wanna go first?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-17 21:11:50):
*[image]*

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-04-17 21:21:29):
(Since the grapple attempt was a fail Filiaur will use/give a hero point to reroll it)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-04-17 21:29:24):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-17 21:31:19):
Garspheal Elstrice is barely hurt.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-17 22:09:32):
(who's next?)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-04-17 22:10:57):
"Necrilla cut this guy's head off so we'll be done with him already @Nemesiux "

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-17 22:29:03):
Necrila moves up and double slice

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-17 22:29:12):
*[image]*

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-17 22:29:56):
first strike slashes at the target eyes and the second beheads him then she looks at the elf and laughs "You are next rude mortal!"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-17 22:35:37):
Sinhow rushes in, stomping over the dead body and ahead to the elf, hoping to catch them offguard before they fire off a shot. Sinhow casts DAZE! He turns his head to the side, and speaks 
"CARDIGAN, HE'S WIDE OPEN, FINISH HIM!"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-17 22:36:56):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-17 22:55:33):
Cardigan phases into Tawhirtle.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-17 22:55:35):
Tawhirtle strides.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-17 22:55:44):
Tawhirtle does a static shock.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-17 22:55:47):
24 to hit.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-17 22:55:50):
8 damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-17 22:55:54):
Tawhirtle becomes CHARGED!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-17 22:56:03):
Tawhirtle is brimming with electrical energy.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-17 22:58:48):
Mad Rat kills the wood elf dead.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-17 22:59:10):
Mad Rat IMMEDIATELY starts to search for the elf's supplies.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-17 23:01:15):
Necrila proceeds to collect the dead bandits' heads

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 00:12:13):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 00:13:36):
The rope is hooked up.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 00:13:54):
And nest to the nest is the tallest tree that grows around the church.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 00:14:08):
You could use the rope to leap into the tree's peak

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 00:14:15):
As it seems the elf often did.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 00:14:25):
Acrobatics to carry out this act.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 00:48:55):
@MrNegetZ

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 04:55:46):
You find a small box.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 04:55:55):
It contains a full set of silver cutlery.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 04:56:01):
And a strange +1 spyglass.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 04:56:09):
The metal and glass are .....not normal.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 04:56:19):
Besides the strange material, it is a +1 spy glass!

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-04-18 08:46:42):
Wym +1 Spyglass?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 10:00:38):
*[image]*

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-18 20:00:47):
Sinhow will turn to Mad Rat, 

"right, room 13 is just up ahead right? Lots of scorpions? Filiuar, are you able to do that cleaning thing again? Might be useful to lure a scorpion trap at it"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 21:31:31):
As Mad Rat continues looking around the room.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-18 22:03:39):
"What are you looking for, Mad rat? Anything we can help you or can we just move on to the scorpion trainers??" Sinhow is impatient, clearly evident in him pacing around the room, around the bodies of the fallen ruffians.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 22:04:34):
Mat Rat shrugs, stops searching, says nothing and awaits the group to continue moving.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-18 22:05:42):
"Okay Filliuar. What are you doing? Can it wait until the bandits are dealt with or does it *have* to be now??" Pacing continues. 

@MrNegetZ

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-19 00:56:07):
"Kill the bandits first then. The money can wait." Sinhow will start herding the group towards room 13.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-19 22:52:58):
@MrNegetZ 

What is the perception check for ?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-19 22:59:05):
@MrNegetZ 

You find nothing.

Just the spy glass and nice silverware.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-19 23:22:22):
Next? :)

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-20 14:48:41):
"Right, room 13, the scorpions. FIlluar you wouldn't happen to have a fireball tucked away in that book would you?" Sinhow herds the party over to the door of the next room, and speaks in hushed tones.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-04-20 15:42:09):
"I could also animate a broom but it won't sweep the scorpions very easely"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-20 15:45:10):
So, Sinhow spends 10 minutes pacing anxiously while Filiuar reads her book, hoping the bandits don't try to investigate the commotions, or even go see their dead friends and ambush us while we wait here.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-29 16:28:17):
If the group is ready to proceed?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-29 16:54:40):
Ok, the group walk up to door 13.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-29 16:55:00):
There is a lot of yelling inside, two voices, they seem to be cheering on some kind of cock fight.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-29 17:04:16):
"Alright Professor, I'll open the door,  you see what you can do about the scorpions and we'll go after the two grunts. Yeah?" Sinhow press his free hand against the door, slowly playing with the rapier in his other.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-29 17:16:44):
Amongst the floor are a few wooden planks forming a shallow arena to 4 monstrous dog-sized scorpions.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-29 17:16:58):
The pair of russians immediately look at who has disturbed them.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-29 17:17:56):
Rasper looks at the party and says:
"PISS OFF.
Can't you see we're in the middle of a fight?
And I'm winning!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-29 17:18:24):
Rumblefist looks annoyed:
"No you're not.

My Scorpion is like an orc, strong and invincible."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-29 17:19:24):
Rasper Ellias replies:
"Not now you brute."

Rasper Ellias resends his attention to the group, spotting Mad Rat:
"Mad Rat, what's all this then?
The boss need us?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-29 17:19:44):
Mad Rat looks at the Riddle port adventures, allowing them to speak, not wanting to speak himself.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-04-29 17:21:46):
Sinhow looks at the professor, expectantly @MrNegetZ
