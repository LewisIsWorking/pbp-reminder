**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-02 12:40:24):
What next? :)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-02 12:43:39):
Yaseitori heads inside, checking out whether someone might be hiding.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-02 12:51:16):
@Askarans 

What next?

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-02 12:53:45):
(Has this bell been rung in the past days?

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-02 12:56:17):
Yaseitori takes a look inside the bell(s), if possible.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-02 13:03:26):
There are arcane runes scrawled upon the bell's surface.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-02 13:14:18):
"Do you know anything about magic writing?" Yaseitori asks Moonshine, his voice reverberating in the bell.

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-02 14:09:02):
(Can I read it? Or decipher it with diverse lore?)

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-02 17:24:04):
(Is that the extent of my knowledge or can I make a roll with Esoteric lore too?)

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-02 18:03:57):
(We’re second level right now so it should be +7 cause Trained +3 and then Charisma +4)

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-02 18:05:10):
(With as many extra feats we’re getting, there’s no way I wasn’t gonna take diverse lore lmao)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-03 07:13:37):
The arcane runes definitely manipulate primal energy.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-03 07:13:55):
We shall say you are able to identify the type/form of primal energy as earth.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-03 07:15:49):
Litho kinesis.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-03 08:53:02):
What next? :)

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-03 14:19:25):
Moonshine stares blankly at the runes and narrows her eyes for a good few seconds, taking a drink from her gourd before turning to Yaseitori with a shrug.

“Yeah, I dunno. It does something with elemental energy if you shake it.”

She wipes down her mouth and puts the gourd away and then reach out for the bell.

“Something to do with the earth element. We could always just try it and see…?”

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-03 14:22:23):
"Uhm.. I wouldn't. Who knows.. maybe ringing that bell turns this building into a Golem or something.." Yaseitori shrugs and begins to make his way to the downstairs.

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-03 14:24:47):
“Aren’t we—“

Moonshine looks over at Yaseitori heading back downstairs and then at the bell and then back at Yaseitori before quickly following him down.

“What were we hoping to find up here? Aren’t we supposed to cut some line?”

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-03 14:26:03):
Yaseitori, standing just on the first step down. "Yes. But have we seen any line except ours?"

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-03 14:39:55):
Moonshine blinks and turn back toward the bell, pointing to the rope it’s hung by.

“Well, the bell… also inside the bell?”

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-03 15:01:24):
Yaseitori steps back up. 
"Okay. What do you think could happen when we ring that bell?"

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-03 15:06:14):
(Can we make Seek checks for the supposed abseiling we’re supposed to sever?)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-03 15:53:00):
Yaseitori walks closer towards the abseiling gear. 
His feathers rustle as he reflexively shakes himself briefly. 
"That must be it. So.. Let's cut it?"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-03 15:54:01):
"Or maybe just weaken the rope just enough so that when he tries to go for it, it looks intact at first glance but when he tries to use it, it tears and he goes.. *descending whistle tone* splatch."

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-03 15:55:02):
(Can we take the climbing kit back down and then rig it to fail with a thievery check? Or is the item a bit too above our level for that?)

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-04 08:55:56):
Moonshine follows Yaseitori back down to the abseiling equipment, watching him as he explained, her gaze shifting back and forth between the Tengu and the climbing kit before looking down the tower. Her eyes widen with excitement as the whistling clicks.

“Oh! Oh, yes, I can try to rig it, yeah!”

She excitedly takes the device back down, her tail flicking back and forth as she brought the rope down the tower. Then, forgetting to wait for Yaseitori, she excitedly starts rigging the equipment into a faulty trap.

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-04 08:56:23):
(Can someone roll my Thievery for me?)

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-04 10:10:16):
(I’m thinking we take it back down first, and with it lowered, we rig it from the bottom? We’re not really sure how it works I guess)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-04 23:16:50):
So what next?

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-05 05:03:58):
(Moonshine does what I said she’s do?)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 11:50:57):
You grab the device, go down the tower and rig it to fall apart when used.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-05 11:50:59):
Then what?

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-05 11:51:50):
+8

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-05 11:52:23):
Miscalculated my esoteric lore earlier, should’ve been +8 too but oh well, whatever

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-06 10:48:05):
When what? :0

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-06 11:16:18):
(Do you guys want me to just blow the whistle now? I was waiting for Yaseitori, but I can have Moonshine just give the signal.)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-07 18:04:24):
Yaseitori decides to wait ontop for now.

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-07 18:58:15):
Moonshine will blow the signal whistle to notify everything within a mile.

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-07 19:19:17):
(Oop)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-09 11:51:10):
This is world #1, so I'll need to swap over.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-12 11:50:43):
Setting up combat...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-12 12:41:03):

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-12 13:01:46):
(Are my Thaumaturge feats/features currently restricted?)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-12 13:02:18):
>> - The party needs to open the door to the spiral stairs room first.
>> - The party are right outside the door to the spiral stairs room.
>> - So Cardigan will step (1-A) to the door, open the door (1-A) and then stride across the room and start climbing the stairs (1-A).
>> - Claude: How far can Cardigan get?
>> - Based on Cardigan's planned actions and movement:
>> - Cardigan's turn breakdown:
>> - Action 1: Step to the door (5 feet)
>> - Action 2: Open door (Interact action)
>> - Action 3: Stride across the room and start climbing stairs (25 feet)
>> - Movement calculation:
>> - Step to the door: 5 feet on flat ground 
>> - Stride across the spiral stairs room: 
>> - Let us assume 10 feet to reach the base of stairs.
>> - Remaining movement for stairs: 25 - 10 = 15 feet of movement 
>> - On difficult terrain stairs: 15 feet of movement = 1.5 squares up the stairs.
>> - Rounding down: 1 square up the spiral stairs 
>> - Result: Cardigan can get 1 square (5 feet vertically) up the spiral stairs on her first turn. 
>> - She will be at the very beginning of her climb, having used her full movement to get into position and start ascending. 
>> - She will need 5 more full move actions (6 total turns) to reach Beltias Kreun's room, assuming she uses her Stride action each subsequent turn.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-12 13:02:38):
By joining the group, you have gained the blessing of the Rune-Wheel.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-12 13:03:13):
Your mind, as you stand upon the platform of the bell tower, a light misty rain falling on your face, your mind fills with knowledge and your magus potential blossoms into a full class!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-12 13:03:15):
@CapriciousC

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-12 13:04:35):
(Yayyy I was already using Esoteric lore before this tho lol)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-12 13:06:00):
Igarashi Enya 五十嵐 炎野's nerve breaks and she runs away.

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-12 13:06:24):
Oof

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-12 14:46:47):
Rax's turn:
>> - Based on Rax's movement capabilities with the door already open:
>> - Rax's turn with the door already open:
>> - Action 1: Stride to stairs and climb (35 feet total).
>> - Action 2: Stride further upstairs (35 feet).
>> - Action 3: Stride further upstairs (35 feet).
>> - Movement calculation:
>> - First Stride: 10 feet across room + 25 feet climbing = 2 full squares upstairs + 5 feet leftover movement.
>> - Second Stride: 35 feet + 5 feet leftover = 40 feet climbing = 4 squares upstairs.
>> - Third Stride: 35 feet climbing = 3 full squares + 5 feet leftover movement.
>> - Total progress:
>> - 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 squares (45 feet vertically) up the spiral stairs.
>> - Since you need 13 squares total to reach Beltias Kreun's room, you would be about 70% of the way there in one turn, needing only 4 more squares (1-2 more actions) to reach the top.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-09-12 15:42:04):
(how do you reflect Yaseitori being at the top and Moonshine being at the bottom?)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-12 16:41:27):
Oh, moon shine did go down.

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-09-12 16:41:38):
@PathWars can you set the scene? What does the corridor look like? How wide are the stairs, how many people can go side to side?

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-09-12 16:42:13):
*[image]* Cardigan will need 6 turns to reach top?

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-09-12 16:50:13):
It's like a brick wall

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-09-12 16:51:55):
Well we'll all go up the spiral staircase then?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-09-14 16:15:07):
(You only answered 1 question)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-14 16:19:29):
@PathWars can you set the scene?  = Yes.

What does the corridor look like? = It's the same corridor that we've been in for the last x months.

How wide are the stairs, how many people can go side to side? = Cardigan opens the door, there is a spiral stair case made of grey stone.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-18 20:16:36):
What next? :)

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-18 22:56:47):
(Probably we all climb the tower, not sure if there’s much else we can do, can you just fast forward a few turns until either everyone’s up or something important happens?)

**Capricious | Riddleport Lenma Moonshine** (2025-09-18 22:57:23):
(Kinda feels like initiative got rolled a bit early 😅)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-21 19:52:48):
Right, I'll just be having everyone move up the stairs then.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-23 04:48:17):
And with X number of actions/etc.

Technically if I was checking for traps on the way everyone is moving slower because they're waiting on me. :p Just thought of that.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-23 05:16:55):
Regardless.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-23 05:18:10):
@Askarans 

Yaseitori. 

This man appears, running up the stairs, he is now next to the bell of the bell tower.

He sees you, he is surprised.

> Round 2: Cardigan.
>> - After using three Stride actions, Cardigan would be 42.5 feet up the stairs. 
>> - Here's the breakdown:
>> - Total Movement: 3 Stride actions at 25 feet each = 75 feet of movement. 
>> - Movement on Stairs: Since stairs are difficult terrain when moving up, the movement cost is doubled. 
>> - So, her 75 feet of movement allow her to ascend 37.5 feet. 
>> - New Position: Starting from 5 feet up, she moves another 37.5 feet, placing her at 42.5 feet up the stairs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-09-29 08:05:40):
> Round 2 Movement Summary
>> - Assuming everyone uses their three actions to Stride up the stairs, accounting for the difficult terrain of the stairs and the flat ground of Kreun's room (assumed to be 15 feet to cross).
