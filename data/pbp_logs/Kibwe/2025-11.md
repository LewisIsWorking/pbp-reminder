"Yes," Kieran acknowledges Tal'lysae, "but what is expected of the city and or of us?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-11-14 19:17:21):
Tal'lysae:
"I will also accept simply helping to defend the city but... you are all so much more capable of...."

Tal'lysae sort of gurgles, her form shivering, vibrating:

"...MORE."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-11-17 10:53:19):
Lorn looks into Tal'lysae's eyes "All of us can become more than what role was assigned to us in this grand game of the divine. We can only achieve this by trusting one another" Lorn then looks at the group, cursebreaker, Ademe and then says "right?"
