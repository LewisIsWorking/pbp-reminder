A pause.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-10 11:39:16):
Tal'lysae gurgles:
"That. I felt it. A disturbance in the air, a movement in the earth. This must end."

**Eimer Hone** (2025-12-10 17:19:46):
“Speak plainly.” Leilani speaks up. “Tal’lysae, what did you feel? What is it?”

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-27 15:40:01):
What happens next? :)

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-12-27 21:36:04):
"I don't know what is going on but we can't just keep discussing this. If things are getting as bad as they say we need to move and now if we want any chance of stopping it before it is too late." Leopard hefts his shield and looks to the city. "Now lets move. We'll figure out the finer points as we go."

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2025-12-29 02:37:54):
"Honestly this isn't what I was hired for, I'm sure you guys can handle it without me." Tiny states as he wanders off

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-29 04:00:49):
Tal'lysae watches as Tiny leaves:
"Dark forces cloud his soul, it is better he leaves now.

You do not want an ally to..."

Tal'lysae quivers:

"stab you in the back...."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-12-29 04:01:30):
What next? :)

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-12-29 23:03:40):
With that final statement, Kieran places his shield in its sheath on his back. He holds his bow in his hands, and a soft glow emits from it as he leads the party into the city.
