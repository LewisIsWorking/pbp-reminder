What happens next? :)

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-01-05 05:09:38):
As things seem to be wrapping up and everyone finishes their preparations and their casting about the room Leopard adjusts his pack on his back and grips his weapon and shield.

"Everyone ready to move forward?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-06 02:39:06):
No one wants to forge the chains?

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-01-06 02:42:47):
Tarsus examines the unfinished armor.
"Would anyone use this armor if I completed this? Looks to be a suit of chain armor with some extra stuff in it, seems we interrupted before they could finish this one."

That is a failure.

What would you like to do?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-06 04:11:48):
In the heart of the ancient plaza's demonic forging room, 
Tarsus Longstaff and Daichi worked tirelessly to complete the moonlit chain armour. 

The unfinished piece, left behind by Angazhan cultists under the fiendish guidance of an Ahvothian, still bore traces of its dark origins.

Tarsus, though no master, was focused and deliberate. 

Using tools scavenged from the cultists’ abandoned forge, he began reforging the chain links. 

Lunar steel, rare and radiant, was melted down in the glowing forge and meticulously added to the corrupted chains. 

Daichi’s strength was indispensable, operating the massive bellows to maintain the exact temperature needed to bind the new metal without damaging the delicate structure. 

The rhythmic clinking of hammer against steel echoed as Tarsus reshaped each link, layer by layer.

With the forging complete, Tarsus turned to the final step: enchanting. 

He inscribed simple yet potent lunar runes along the inner edges of the armour, using an etching tool dipped in a mixture of stardust and melted lunar steel. 

Daichi stood beside him, channeling a primal, almost instinctual energy into the process. 

His low growls seemed to hum through the armour, activating the enchantments and binding the moonlit blessings to the steel.

Now the work is done, the armour shimmered faintly in the dim light, its dark past erased by their efforts. 

Tarsus sweat drips from your fur.

The armour stands as a testament to your shared skill, a creation forged in shadow and brought into the light.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-01-07 02:40:19):
Leopard sighs as he approaches the door.

"Now I'm not the most careful guy, but can we at least pretend that caution exists as a concept?"

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2025-01-08 02:30:56):
Tiny shakes his head "don't worry about traps, I usually manage to get out of the way in time" (I've got trap sense). "If you guys don't have any better idears the the bust the door down and stab strategy is basically foolproof."

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-01-08 02:45:01):
"OK everyone check yourselves and get ready I'll open the door"
Daichi will go towards the "device" next to the door and prepare to open it once everyone is ready.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-09 15:34:29):
Lorn hunts prey on one of the guys behind the door

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-01-09 16:16:31):
He has imprecise smell so whoever is the closest 30ft from him

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-01-10 06:23:41):
Leopard positions himself in front of one side of the sliding double doors, his weapons at the ready for the upcoming melee.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-01-10 07:29:43):
Daichi Interacts with the pannel to open the door and perpares to rush at the first guy he sees.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-12 20:20:43):
You notice two things.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-12 23:46:03):
Firstly:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-12 23:46:06):
At the center of the room, one table stands out—a crude, uneven slab of wood covered in a sickening patina of grime, dried blood, and dark, viscous stains. Upon its surface rests an unnerving artifact: a half-finished book, unlike any conventional tome. The pages are thin metal plates, cold and tarnished, strung together by thick, rusted wires that twist and coil like barbed serpents. The plates clink faintly against one another as if whispering their own story, their edges jagged and uneven, some bent and warped, as though scorched by fire or clawed by something monstrous.

Each page is etched with a level of detail so grotesque it borders on the surreal. The images are scenes of unimaginable carnage, all centered on a horrifying figure—Angazhan, depicted as a towering dinosaur-like monstrosity with six razor-sharp claws on each limb. The carvings are so deeply and expertly inscribed that they seem to leap from the plates, the metallic grooves stained with what appears to be a mixture of dark ink and dried blood, lending the images a visceral, almost animate quality. The beast's claws are rendered with jagged precision, each one dripping with the torn viscera of its victims, the gore pooling beneath its towering form in rivers that seem to glisten unnaturally.

The creatures being torn apart vary grotesquely: humanoid figures whose agonized faces are twisted in terror, their limbs severed and flesh flayed to the bone; monstrous, nightmarish beings with gaping maws and too many eyes, their bodies shredded into unrecognizable pulp; and even immense, majestic beasts, reduced to nothing more than broken, bleeding husks beneath Angazhan's wrath. One plate in particular captures a horrifying moment—a demonic priest offering up a bound and helpless sacrifice, their face frozen in abject horror as Angazhan descends upon them, claws tearing into flesh with unrelenting ferocity.

The artistry is both meticulous and deeply unsettling, the kind of precision that could only come from a mind wholly consumed by madness or devotion. In places, the images are carved so deeply into the plates that the metal has cracked, creating jagged edges that lend an unsettling realism to the depicted carnage. Small pools of dark fluid have gathered in these cracks, as if the book itself is bleeding.

Scattered around the book are the tools of its grim creation: an assortment of thin, sharp chisels caked with dried blood and metal filings, crude mallets with splintered handles, and pots of ink so black it seems to absorb the dim light of the room. A small bowl sits to one side, filled with a thick, red liquid—clearly blood—its surface dotted with the floating remnants of herbs and bone fragments. It is clear that this blood is not just a medium but an offering, imbued with ritual significance. The faint scent of iron mingles with a sharper, acrid smell that burns the nostrils.

A closer look reveals that the wire binding the plates is far from ordinary. It is not simply twisted metal but appears to be braided from strands of barbed wire and something disturbingly organic—perhaps sinew or tendon, dried and stretched unnaturally thin. The wire cuts deeply into the edges of the plates, leaving jagged tears and warped corners as though the book resists being bound, as if it is alive and straining to break free.

The table beneath the book is not merely a workbench but a stage for its creation. Around its perimeter, dark symbols and runes have been carved deeply into the wood. These markings, smeared with blood and ash, seem to pulsate faintly with a malevolent energy, their forms twisting unnaturally when viewed from the corner of the eye. Beneath the table, the floor is stained black with countless spills of blood, ink, and melted wax, the residue forming a swirling, chaotic mosaic of violence and devotion.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-12 23:46:06):
This is no simple craft project—it is a labor of worship, a testament to the cultists' depravity and unwavering reverence for Angazhan. The half-finished book radiates a palpable malice, as though the very act of looking upon it invites madness. It is not just a relic in progress; it is an offering, a tool, and a weapon, imbued with the darkest aspects of faith and fear, destined to bring the horrors it depicts into grim reality.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-12 23:46:19):
Secondly:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-12 23:48:58):
The four cultists, while they are praying in their gore covered robes, are primarily focusing on repairing a wide variety of items.

Weapons, armour, pieces of carts, clockwork, equipment, vials, and much more.

All either gathered from this facility, from the outside world or crafted in the demonic forges built in room like the one you have just come from.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-12 23:49:41):
It seems between prayers they seem to be one upping each other on the acts of depravity they have committed in the name of their faith, and the acts they plan to one day carry out.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-12 23:52:11):
Their heads immediately snap to the Eastern doors that the group have just slammed open.

The cultists spring to their feet, weapons in hand as part of their reaction to the party's appearance.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-12 23:52:15):
COMBAT.

Lorn had already hunt prey the cultist closest to him(effect applied)

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-01-14 14:23:38):
Leopard strides forward,attempts to Intimidate the bottom right cultist, and raises shield

You've charged forward, screeching at the closest cultist, he is taken aback and is now frightened 1.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-15 09:29:19):
You raise your shield.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-15 10:08:23):
Fierce Leopard's turn is over ( @RyoYamakawa ).

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-15 10:08:26):
Who is next? :)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-01-15 11:27:31):
Daichi will cast light near the cultists (20 ft bright 40ft dim i placed the area but you'll need to create a light source). And enter arcane cascade.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-01-15 11:54:57):
Eda will go next.
She will devise a stratagem for free(he is part of the investigation) on the frightened cultist.
She gets a 20. (ATTACK STRATAGEM!!!!)
She also gets a free recall knowledge on him as per known weakness. She will want to know if the cultist is weak to any elemental or physical type of damage or if he is resistant against any elemental or physical type of damage (not asking about holy/unholly since we don't have these types of damages). If none are applicable she will try to get their lowest saving throw. If you have trouble reading the result screenshot it. Ill be using either society, occultism or religion skills probably since they are a cult but they seem humanoid.
(Waiting for the recall knowledge result and you putting the light source down).

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-15 13:25:55):
*[image]* Light placed.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-15 13:32:18):
What next? :)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-01-15 15:02:29):
*[image]* 42 + 14x2=28(because it doesn't auto roll a critical hit with the spell) + 1d6 or 3 bleed (Either from Scalpel's point or Needle Darts crit)
Total: 70 + bleed

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-01-15 15:02:52):
Strategic assessment lets me learn something about the target. (Choose depending on context or roll a D4 idk.)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-01-15 15:03:40):
Shared Stratagem will make the enemy flat footed on Lorn's attack(i probably didn't one shot it).

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-01-15 15:07:00):
So Lorn should go next to finish off his hunted prey.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-16 09:00:50):
@MrNegetZ He's dead.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-01-16 09:01:12):
Still get strategic assesment tho

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-16 09:21:42):
He has no weaknesses, resistances or immunities.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-01-16 09:22:05):
You are supposed to give me something applicable

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-01-16 09:22:16):
So if he has nothing you give me the lowest saving throw

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-16 10:51:22):
Who is next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-17 20:02:08):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-19 10:58:19):
The cultist, in considerable pain, looks at you Tiny and spews in common:
"As I suffer my god feeds on my pain, you make him stronger as my blood seeps into the sacred ground we walk upon!"

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-01-19 16:17:29):
*[image]* "I wonder how pleased your god would be if you offered him watered-down wine."
Tarsus casts Pillar of Water (15-foot radius, floor to 60 feet or ceiling, whichever comes first)
Centered on this point:

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-01-19 16:23:02):
(End turn, it's a 3-action spell)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-24 13:12:53):
@buffetraider 

The pillar of water will only effect the South western (3rd) cultist.

As only 1 square of the other two are effected.

Right?

I believe the majority of a token has to be within range?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-24 13:25:21):
The only partially submerged creatures are not drowning but they are going to have to spend additional movement cost to move out of the difficult terrain.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-24 13:25:59):
@buffetraider 

Tarsus Longstaff's turn is over.

Who's turn is it now?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-28 22:34:17):
With demonic strength and bestial howling they charge Tiny.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-28 22:35:18):
Tiny takes 17, 18 and 38 points of damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-28 22:36:49):
Tiny has 38 hit points remaining.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-28 22:41:27):
@errror01 

The magically enlarged cultists charged at you Tiny, they speared you a total of 3 times.

The 2 times they hit through the flesh of your stomach was painful, drawing blood from the puncher wounds, however it is nothing in comparison to the 3rd strike.

The 3rd strike was a vicious impaling strike through the leg, you feel bone splinter and break.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-28 22:41:32):
However you are still standing.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-28 22:42:30):
Thanks to a combination of your resiliency and the water pillar for slowing down the cultist's approach, making them unable to attempt to land an additional blow.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-01-28 22:42:34):
It is round 2.
