What happens next?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-01 20:03:13):
The panel is located, but not disabled.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-11-01 20:17:06):
Lorn moves towards the panel and tries to disable it

21+10=31

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-02 13:54:31):
Lorne approaches the panel, using the insight gained from his companion's attempts he slips his bones into the arcane circuitry.

As Lorne pulls a few wires loose, an internal runestone glows slightly. 

Not good.


A few seconds of difference will be the difference between people being seriously injured or perfectly fine.

As perfectly fine as one can be in such a God forsaken place.

Lorne takes his crystalline bone hands and traces a seven pointed star into the rune stone.

This is rune magic and Lorne is a runic skeleton.
He will have control.

And surely enough, control is his.

The traced symbol breathes into life with a flicker of magic, the rune stone acknowledges the superior level of access and through the energy system of this facility a surge of power floods the miniature rune stone, flooding it, and ultimately causing it to crack, splinter and turn to ash.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-02 13:54:57):
The panel is disabled, congratulations and the door forward appears safe to open and proceed through.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-02 17:04:02):
What happens next?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-11-02 18:08:58):
We need to rest and refocus I think

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-11-10 17:36:26):
I'll provide assistance with the scouting as I have imprecise scent

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-11-10 17:48:59):
And if I detect anyone with it I will use Point Out for a more focused Seek by my allies.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-11 20:02:04):
What happens next? :)

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-11-12 02:55:17):
Fierce Leopard just sighs and shakes his head before walking up to Lorn and with a fluid motion lifts the skeleton and carries them back 30 some odd feet from the door before placing them back on their feet. "Ok, so who wants to check what kind of trouble this one might have caused?"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-11-13 01:53:15):
Fierce Leopard will approach the panel and check for traps.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-11-13 02:00:32):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-13 02:25:44):
@RyoYamakawa 

You find no traps.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-13 03:07:11):
What happens next?

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-11-13 03:11:39):
"Everyone ready?" He stands there with his hand hovering over the panel to open the door, waiting for the all-clear.

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2024-11-13 19:45:43):
Tarsus stows his notebook and readies his staff.
"Go for it."

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2024-11-13 22:44:59):
"go ahead, we're safely behind you"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-11-14 00:22:07):
He will Raise Shield and will touch the panel to open the door.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-14 12:06:10):
At the end of the room is some form of arcane machine made of the same dark grey stone as the rest of the laboratory.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-14 12:27:23):

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2024-11-14 20:08:46):
Tarsus will make his way to the device at the back of the room, tapping floor tiles in his path with his staff to hopefully avoid any shenanigans.
He would like to investigate the device to determine its function.

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2024-11-14 20:08:55):
Arcana

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-19 02:45:01):
What happens next? :)

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2024-11-19 02:46:53):
What is the object it contains?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-19 02:47:27):
What happens next? :)

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2024-11-19 02:48:59):
Tarsus opens the hatch on the device.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-19 04:02:27):
It is not covered in slime, the slime seems to have melted from it's form after being exposed to the air in matter of seconds.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-19 04:02:38):
While the glob is magical, only a fraction of it's magic remains.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-19 04:02:45):
What happens next? 

:)

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2024-11-19 08:01:28):
Tarsus examines the flesh. Is the source creature identifiable or is it too desiccated to learn anything from it?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-19 10:21:44):
What happens next? 

:)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-11-19 14:20:32):
/roll 1d20+11

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-19 17:54:48):
The flesh was not always this item but has instead become this over time.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-19 17:55:51):
The machine's light turns off.

The ooze flushes down a central ventilation shaft, deep, deep into the ground.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-19 17:56:32):
The vases glow and disconnect from the arcane wiring.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-19 17:56:50):
Then the room is silent and still.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-19 17:56:57):
So, what happens next?

:)

**Eimer Hone** (2024-11-19 20:46:46):
Leilani Kana enters. 

“Hi. I’m Leilani Kana. I am sent by the city of Kibwe to recover curse breaker.”

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-20 23:45:34):
What happens next? :)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-11-21 17:15:32):
It's actually quite a big room apparently so i think we'll need to search at least 10-15 min.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-11-21 22:48:07):
FL will assist in searching the room to speed up the process.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-11-21 22:48:29):
Lorn will search too

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-11-21 22:49:26):
/roll 1d20+12

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-11-21 22:52:30):
/roll 1d20+12

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-23 21:12:06):
You all find nothing additional in the room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-23 21:12:28):
Except some broken pieces of rocks and pottery, none of it seems valuable or of interest.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-24 22:33:01):
What happens next? :)

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-11-24 22:34:45):
Is there another door out or we gotta continue down the hall from where we entered?

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-11-25 20:35:06):
Any vaguely identifiable scents from either up the stairs or down the stairs?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-25 21:13:43):
What happens next? :)

**Eimer Hone** (2024-11-25 21:22:06):
Leilani Kana ponders. 

“I vote for going up the stairs. ”

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2024-11-25 21:23:23):
When facing away from Ademe's room, which route is to the left?

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2024-11-25 21:31:38):
"I vote we check the basement in case they have another butcher shop or laboratory down there. Distinct possibility by the smell of it, wouldn't want more of those weirdos sneaking up on us."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-11-25 23:21:40):
"I agree. We're supposed to be the ones sneaking up on them."

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-11-25 23:27:08):
"I also agree, going up the stairs will probably put us back where there was a secret door on the northern part so it's better to go down first and then check this place. Since we dealt with the guards fast enough i don't think they are on alert yet so let's be carreful"

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2024-11-26 13:13:12):
"I vote down, it's where I would hide the loot."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-11-26 14:21:58):
What happens next? :)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-11-26 14:47:01):
In accordance with the party majority vote we will go down D stairs.

**Eimer Hone** (2024-11-26 16:50:00):
“Downstairs it is” Leilani sighs
