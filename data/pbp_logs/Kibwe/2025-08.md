**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-02 18:38:27):

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-02 19:15:33):
"Daichi looks at the room being covered in darkness, looks at the spears thrown at aqua and says:
"Yeah... We're not fighting in that room. Go behind the wall everyone and let them come out. If you want to fight in the room where half of us can't see shit then it's your fault if you die... someone pick up Akwa.."
Daichi will stride down, cast shield and enter arcane cascade.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-02 19:21:55):
*[image]* Using the magic from his gloves, he will mend Akwa's wounds. "C'mon friend, you shall not die today."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-02 19:23:09):
(I kinda imagine it in your case that you transferred some slime over to my body. xD)

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-02 19:24:21):
*[image]* The shield in his hand flashes a brief reflection of Akwa, providing a faint barrier over the two. His sword begins to shine brightly as the glow within the shield fades. Afterwards, Kieran will follow Daichi, making sure to place himself between him and the threats within the room.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-02 19:24:33):
End Kieran's turn.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-02 19:30:12):
"Gleaming Blade", my shortsword

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-02 19:38:34):
Lorn focusses on the sounds the demon in the front is making to Hunt Prey. He moves back to get a better angle.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-02 19:41:07):
Akwa's body bubbles as it recoalesces into a more cohesive form. 
She wobbles as she readjusts her body to stand up. Hearing the shout to get behind a wall, she heads for cover, moving 40ft towards the wall.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-02 19:48:58):
Eda follows the strategy and goes back behind the party, she casts light to see a bit better.

**Eimer Hone** (2025-08-07 19:30:04):
Leilani Kana attempts to heal Tiny with a 3rd-rank healing spell, but the spell fails to find its mark in the oppressive darkness. Disappointed that she couldn’t do more to help, she turns and quickly makes her way to her companions, keeping close to the wall of the vault.

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-08-07 23:37:24):
Tarsus reshapes his spell to cast it at long range. He dehydrates the enemy near Tiny, causing damage over time.
(1 action reach spell, 2 actions cast dehydrate)

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-08-07 23:43:13):
Yes, and dehydrate targets an area as opposed to a specific creature.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-07 23:43:17):

*[image]* With a primal roar Leopard charges into the room after his injured ally, Reaching his side he smashes his shield into the demon's chest and with a squelch it pierces the body and the soft tissue beneath the surface. Pulling it back he raises his shield to defend himself.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-15 21:50:36):
*[image]* Kieran, shaking his head in mild disbelief at the two who rushed into the darkness, moves himself around the corner, unwilling to let them suffer their fate. The weapon and shield in his hand slip into their sheaths on his back in what appears to be an instant, and a bow is now drawn, a crackling arrow readied and aimed. He lets it loose onto the demon furthest from the door. It strikes true.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-15 21:51:50):
Stride->Lightning Swap->Strike. End Kieran's turn

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 21:53:44):
Does it hit Tiny ?

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-15 21:56:26):
It probably does, I honestly forgot my arrows do splash. But its 2 to everyone in 5 ft.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-15 21:58:06):
*[image]* Akwa summons a Mudwretch, which then walks over to the closest demon and whacks it.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-15 22:00:07):
*[image]* Also 10ft around it is difficult terrain

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-15 22:07:50):
((With current knowledge, that Devil/Demon I hit is Stunned 2))

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-15 22:09:09):
I crit it with a piercing weapon. The crit deck draw said the monster has stunned 2

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:13:02):
@Linksanelf2006 
In future, please screenshot the crit deck pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee ❤️

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-15 22:13:12):
Or I could have missed that

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-15 22:13:43):
I'm getting it now. Like I said in the other chat, very new to the deck. I'll get it right next time.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-19 09:17:11):
*[image]* Still not seing much in the room, Daichi walks to the corner and tries to counteract the darkness(probably a fail since the effect is lvl 5 although idk the DC so  i put in 25).

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-19 09:18:52):
*[image]* Lorn aims through the darkness at the Demon he is tracking.
(Hunters aim)
He shoots but doesn't see it exaclty so it misses.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-19 09:20:38):
*[image]* He decides to spray and pray(hunted shot) to hopefully catch him on an arrow. And he does.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-19 09:24:41):
*[image]* As she also can't see much, Eda also attempts a counteract on the darkness:

2 action heal

**Eimer Hone** (2025-08-19 18:57:41):
I have low light vision

**Eimer Hone** (2025-08-19 18:57:45):
Is it DC 5 or DC 11 ?

**Eimer Hone** (2025-08-19 18:58:37):
I rerolled with a hero point

**Eimer Hone** (2025-08-19 18:58:41):
But it is red

**Eimer Hone** (2025-08-19 18:59:33):
*[image]*

**Eimer Hone** (2025-08-19 18:59:46):
I rolled another 11 and 11 is normally black

**Eimer Hone** (2025-08-19 18:59:54):
Does it not take the hero point re-roll into account ?

Leilani Kana

**Eimer Hone** (2025-08-19 19:02:20):
Leilani runs past Kieran and casts healing to try to help heal Tiny.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-19 19:06:54):
Why is it red, like a fail

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-19 19:06:59):
If it is a success

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-19 19:07:04):
Which an 11 is.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-19 19:11:28):
If the low reroll is indeed taken into account then it would make sense how she got an 11 but it's red.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-19 19:12:14):
Hmmm ok

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-19 19:12:23):
I'll extend the roll

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-19 19:12:35):
Also the flat check buttons come from PF2e Workbench or Toolbelt so

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-19 19:12:50):
It could be a module to system integration bug.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-19 19:21:46):
*[image]* Apparently it was a 1 with a +10

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-19 19:27:48):
Ah crap.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-19 19:29:46):
Then she succeeded on the first roll!!

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-19 19:29:52):
No need to reroll.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-19 19:29:57):
Put back the hero points.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-19 19:31:15):
Yeah done, great, sorted then :)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-19 19:32:34):
Next time @HistoricallyInaccurate if you target someone in darkness. Put the blinded condition on yourself. Target and cast. Roll the flat check from the spell. Then you can remove blinded.
That's what i did for Lorn.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-19 19:36:52):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-19 19:37:07):

It's just that his tail spin and sneak attack damage are in at a different time

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-08-21 02:12:11):
*[image]* Leopard turned and made his way around Tarsus to strike out at the second demon with a quick strike from his flail and shield. The flail made solid impact, but the momentum from the quick movement and the swing of the flail almost caused him to miss wide. However, he managed to somehow recover just enough to hit the side of the demon.

*[image]* Tarsus focuses for a moment to enter Arcane Cascade.
Hearing the impact of Leopard's weapons, he is able to accurately judge the enemy's position and sweep the legs. (successful trip attempt).
Tarsus begins charging up another spellstrike.
(1 action stance, 1 action trip, 1 action recharge spellstrike)

I think none hit

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-08-21 06:11:04):
He rolled a nat 1 on the reroll of the first attack, the second failed the concealed check twice, and the third is a crit miss.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-21 06:12:06):
Considering your health & stamina

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-21 06:12:13):

If the demon critically hits you to down you, Tiny dies from his wounded condition.

Kieran darts into the room, the bow in his hand now a sword again, his shield in the other. He places himself between the demon and Tiny. He focuses his attention on the devil, his sword's coloration shifting into the tone of a cold iron weapon.

Tiny, as you went to strike your opponent the Demon's slick blood causes you to lose your footing and the demon grabs your long spear and shoves the pointed down tip straight through your leg.

Ok, before that last damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-22 02:51:10):
He was on ONE HP.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-22 02:51:20):
If that last hit didn't go through, he would have tanked it.

Tavik:
"Well fought."

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-22 03:01:54):
Everyone that is hurt takes a MANDATORY 10 MIN BREAK to take a breather or Daichi spellstrikes them.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-22 03:02:23):
Ademe says to Lorn:
"You did well, my champion."

Rarely heard warmth fills her voice.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-22 03:10:52):
Eda "Curse Breaker" Stonesworth falls to her knees, tears running down her face:
"FINALLY.
I have found you.
I have found myself.
I... I have so much to ask you... so much to....."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-22 03:11:28):
Eda "Curse Breaker" Stonesworth's eyes go wide, looking at the massive statue: 
"C...curse-breaker?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-22 03:11:41):
Eda "Curse Breaker" Stonesworth rushes to the statue.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-22 03:17:51):
Eda "Curse Breaker" Stonesworth's nose is bleeding as her hand touches the statue:
"Your...dead....no...this cannot be."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-22 03:18:18):
Eda "Curse Breaker" Stonesworth collapses on the ground, eyes closed, facing Curse Breaker.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-22 03:18:58):
Eda "Curse Breaker" Stonesworth says nothing.

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-08-22 03:32:35):
Tarsus takes a moment to rest. (spend resolve to refill stamina)
Seeing Eda's reaction to the statue, he walks over and begins to examine the statue with read aura.
"This statue was supposed to be...part of you, more or less wasn't it? What do you mean it's dead?"

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2025-08-22 03:57:42):
Tiny grunts, "can anyone stop this bleeding?" (I think i need treat wounds to get rid of wounded)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-22 04:22:09):
Tears stream down Eda "Curse Breaker" Stonesworth's face.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-22 05:17:27):
Kieran moves slowly over towards the statue and Eda. He drops to his knees next to her, and places his arm around her shoulders. He hopes to comfort her with a firm embrace. 
"Hope is not yet lost. You are still here, a small piece or otherwise..." He speaks softly. "You are still here."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-22 23:32:53):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-23 08:53:44):
What do you want to do next?

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-08-23 21:26:30):
*[image]* Tarsus focuses on the statue, straining for any magical connection between it and Eda.

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-08-23 21:29:46):
Tarsus nudges Eda.
"There's still traces of magic here. Give me some time and I might be able to figure out why it has gotten so weak."
He continues to study the trace of magic in the statue.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-23 22:47:46):
You gain knowledge.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-23 22:56:13):
Akwa, after taking a breather, follows but she keeps distance for now and resummons her Eidolon.

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-08-24 02:02:03):
After some time, Tarsus relaxes. 
"Curse Breaker appears to have spent all of its magic, and even burned part of its soul to break that curse earlier. Its soul is greatly diminished and basically dormant, which is why it's almost undetectable. Since Eda is connected to Curse Breaker, she could probably sacrifice her own life force to revive it. I don't know if there is any other immediate solution, or whether Curse Breaker will recover on its own."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-24 06:01:51):
Eda "Curse Breaker" Stones-worth's eyes go wide open and says:
"Really?
My life for his?
Easily!
How?"

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-24 16:02:26):
At first, Kieran got ready to protest, but found himself unable to. 

Only moments ago did he, himself, choose to risk all that he is for an outcome he has yet to understand. At least Eda truly knows what's at stake and what will happen in her choice.

He looks at Eda, "Are you sure that you do not wish to seek out an alternative?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-08-24 16:16:58):
Lorn simply states " if she is a shard of cursebreaker then her uniting with it won't kill her. It wpuld simply transfer her piece into a new body and repair their damaged soul. I think"

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-08-24 18:10:35):
"We'll need to conduct a ritual to siphon your life force and channel it into Curse Breaker. I think we'll need four spellcasters to handle it."

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-24 18:21:51):
" Hmm.. I don't like the idea of loosing Eda. But i suppose simple prayers won't  be enough to sustain curse-breaker until we can get it back to the city and have more people to pray to it...
Lorn is right, if Eda eventually broke off from Curse Breaker, it could happen again once Curse Breaker has regained it's abilities. But we might not even be alive to see the moment...
I'll help with the ritual if Eda is ready to go through with it. "

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-08-24 18:28:43):
Thinking of something else Daichi will ask Lorn while glancing at Ademe.
"Wait, Lorn @Nemesiux , can Ademe relay a message to the city?  if it's even still standing... I would like to try to ask the city officials to organise a coordinated prayer effort for curse breaker. Maybe it will work even this far off we never know. We could try this method before doing anything harsh."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-08-24 21:52:38):
religion?

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-08-24 21:52:53):
Lorn asks  "Who is good with religion?"

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-08-24 22:09:09):
"I have a basic understanding of all spell traditions, though most of my knowledge and my own spells are arcane."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-24 22:11:48):
"My magic is mostly elemental based, I know a bit of the magic of Song, though."

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2025-08-25 17:27:10):
"Tiny knows some basic magic, but I can't help with anything till I get these wounds looked at"

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-26 16:57:19):
*[image]* ((I assume you meant perception when you said "insight"))

Kieran looks into Eda's eyes, seeing the sadness and fear within them. He knows what it is like to have the lives of others hanging in the balance of our choices. He inhales deeply, trying to quickly formulate what words he must speak next.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-26 18:04:34):
Exhaling slowly, Kieran speaks to Eda softly. 
"Let us set a few things straight. We are not choosing between you and Curse Breaker, because you are Curse Breaker." With a short pause, he continues, "We will not simply allow fifteen thousand lives to perish, but that does not mean we have to resort to the first and easiest solution we come across." 
"We have great power here among us, great minds, and even greater hearts. We will find a way to save you, and Kibwe." He feels confident in the words he speaks, and he stands to his feet, helping Eda to hers as well. 
He calls out to the group, "What other options do we have? I made a deal with gram... someone very powerful, certainly we can find a way to use that power to prevent an unnecessary sacrifice."

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-08-26 18:38:46):
"Is there any other way to rekindle the soul of a mythical being? It's not like we're talking about a few spells' worth of magic here. Also not a problem I've had to deal with before so I don't really know where else to begin than with Eda's connection."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-27 23:20:07):
"We have Curse Breaker here," indicating Eda, "and I suspect the reason why she is the most optimal sacrifice is because she is both the conduit and a suitable power source for this artifact." He looks at Eda briefly before turning back to the rest of the party. 
"I also suspect that her life is the cost because we are transferring her..." he tries to find an appropriate word, "life energy into actual energy to power the artifact." He points to Eda, "So, with Eda being the conduit that allows the energy to flow properly into the statue, can we supply an alternative energy source to that thing?" This time, he points to the statue.
"Like, someone else's life energy? Or maybe a combination of small pieces of multiple others' life energy?"

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-08-28 00:22:09):
"If all it takes is a life, we can just use Theron. Punishment fitting the crime and whatnot. Also slightly poetic for him to be the catalyst that undoes his life's work."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-28 09:32:22):
....what next?

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-28 20:00:43):
((Are we able to use a different sacrifice to try and power the statue? What sort of check would that be?))

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-29 09:18:00):
👀

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-08-29 12:03:06):
Akwa looks at the statue a bit perplexed about the situation.
"So.. what do we have to do with the statue? Just stare at it? Cast our magic into it?"

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-08-29 15:10:29):
"Well," Kieran starts, "we should look into modifying that sacrificial ritual." 
He will look at Tarsus, "you seem to know the most about this ritual, where do you think is the best place to start?"

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-08-29 20:07:03):
"I don't know how long a process like this is supposed to take, rituals aren't something I've studied much. We could just swap out Eda for Theron, but it would take some time to ensure there aren't any negative side effects of doing that."
(waiting on results of recall knowledge checks)

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-08-31 19:16:13):
bad roll lol

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-31 19:16:19):
@buffetraider 

So what are you taking from this?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-31 19:16:25):
As in what skill were you attempting to use.

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-08-31 19:16:57):
arcana, was trying to investigate problems with swapping Eda for Theron

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-08-31 19:20:19):
To find the knowledge and perform the ritual is possible, but beyond how much time you have available.
