**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-03 22:17:16):
You are unsure what languages these are.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-07-03 22:24:39):
You can only get it to expert but I am trained.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-07-03 22:42:45):
"What have we got here? Something looking like ancient Varissian or something and some planar language? Yeah there's no way I'm gonna read that."

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2024-07-04 18:37:06):
"There are two languages here. One is Sin-speak, which seems to be intermingled with magic. the other is something that screws with my head if I try to read it.

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2024-07-15 13:34:09):
Tarsus grunts in frustration after a botched attempt at making a copy of the inscriptions. 

"Damn, magical languages are worse than trying to copy spells from a wizard with awful penmanship. The sinspeak is what appears to be lab notes regarding attempts to take shapechanging spells and forcibly inflicting them on large groups of people. Called it 'bio-hacking' or 'bio-magic". They were working with ooze form in particular in this case."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-07-15 16:18:01):
Fierce Leopard spends a few extra moments confirming what he found before raising his head from the wall and turning to the group. "Might have ourselves a secret room or passage over here."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-19 02:50:57):
With a careful inspection of the wall, there seems to be a lock mechanism that could be opened with a thievery check.

The lock has a symbol of an anvil on the lock.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-19 02:51:08):
DO you use thievery to attempt to open the lock?

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2024-07-19 03:19:50):
Tiny scratches his head and tries the mechanism

Crafting recall knowledge check

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-19 03:25:09):
If a member of the group was much more athletic, one day this may be possible.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-07-19 03:58:46):
Pulling out his own lockpicks from a belt pouch Fierce Leopard steps up. "I'm not as confident with my lockpicking skills, but could give it a try."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-07-19 04:04:29):
"Sure, that's fine as well." Seeing them pull out their lockpicks he whistled in admiration. "I can see why you feel more confidant. You got the good kind. I'm more smash and grab so still got the basic ones."

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2024-07-19 04:07:46):
"watch for the third pin I felt a lot of counter rotation, ah and maybe this will help" Tiny reads some scribbles on the back of his hand and casts guidance on Daichi

Aid check on Theivery

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-07-19 04:09:55):
"Ok here goes"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-07-19 04:27:52):
Fierce Leopard growled lightly as he half glared half studied the lock. "What is with this damned thing? And that anvil on it just makes me want to take an anvil to it."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-07-19 04:43:53):
Grunting he looks around and then back to the others. "Then where to next? Wanna get out of here before I decide to wail on it with my flail. Might break my weapon before I break the wall knowing our luck right now."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-07-19 09:17:02):
"Unless you want me to actually break something I suggest we go with the path that's unlocked."

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2024-07-20 10:35:34):
Tarsus makes a quick diagram of the room to remember the location of the locked door. 
 
"Yeah, let's move on for now."

He packs up his notes and readies his staff.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-26 06:23:11):
Ok you make your way back to the lobby.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-26 06:25:29):
There is a set of unlocked double doors to the south.

Would you like to open the double doors?

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2024-07-26 16:48:37):
Tiny pushes the doors open

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-26 17:20:16):
You immediately hear flies, they swarm out of the room, immediately biting your flesh as well as the flesh of your companions.

The buzzing is loud.
The nipping at your flesh will bring up swelling and infection.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-26 17:20:42):
The room itself is a long rectangular room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-26 17:22:04):
Along the centre of the room are rows of wooden benches that stretch the length of the room almost up to the Western and Eastern walls.

Along all the walls of this room are large iron tubs, troughs, not unlike long deep bath tubs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-26 17:22:09):
They are filled with gore.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-26 17:22:20):
Blood stains every centimeter of this room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-26 17:23:06):
Corpses, carcasses and "meat" hang from the ceiling on the ends of wicked sharp curved hooks.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-26 17:23:41):
Along the benches are the bodies of animals, people (both humanoid and non-humanoid) and monsters.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-26 17:23:50):
They are all in various stages of processing.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-26 17:24:12):
Standing giving what seems to be somewhere between a prayer and a tutorial is this being:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-26 17:26:01):
Standing next to this blood soaked fiend are two cultists.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-26 17:26:36):
They stand, covered in gore, learning, listening to the fiend, convening in the fiend's dark language.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-26 17:26:40):
*[gif]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-26 17:28:23):
The fiend raises his cleaver, a splosh of blood flicks off the weapon.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-07-26 17:28:53):
With a terrible screeching roar from the fiend, the cultists turn immediately.

Combat begins.
