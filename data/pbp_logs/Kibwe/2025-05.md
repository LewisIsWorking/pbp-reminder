**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-12 16:40:24):
The 1d6 came from the auto rolled trip check, unless I am misunderstanding.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-05-12 16:40:32):

Could you screen cap and explain your turn here please? ❤️

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-05-12 17:26:00):
*[image]* Leopard moves up to the female cultist and swings his flail and shield. The flail swings true completely bypassing her defense scoring a savage hit, however the savagery of the swing make the preceding shield swing slightly off tilt and barely grazes her, not causing any sort of noticable impact or damage.

Critical Hit.
Dealing 43(40 bludgeoning+ 3 fire) damage with his staff(student of the staff adds deadly d6 on my staff in arcane cascade as the same type of damage but automation isn't working so i rolled seperatly and got a 1).
And
16 x 2 = 32 fire damage with his spell (spellstrike macro doesn't take into account critical hit for auto roll damage so you'll have to double it)

Gorilla cultist #1 is dead, burned to death in the fireball's explosion.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-17 21:52:28):

Tarsus conjures a bolt of briny water and hurls it at Theron, and enters Arcane Cascade.
end turn

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-17 22:51:10):
She is at death's door.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-05-19 01:04:34):
Leopard wades into the middle of the raptor demon and female cultist, building momentum with his flail as he swings it preparing for the strike. With a hard twist of his arm he bring the rotating chain around, smashing against the side of the demon's ribs solidly and without stopping his swing it continues its deadly path breaking through the defense of the cultist beside it, crashing into her jaw, the two enemies falling from the fierce strike.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-19 01:19:52):
And as the light leaves the eyes of the female cultist you see fear enter the eyes of the devotee, fearful of what is next to come for her.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-19 01:21:48):
Iwao Aldori sheathes his sword and says:
"The game is over Theron, I don't wanna be dying for no lost cause.
As for you lot, good luck, I gotta go see a dragon about a painting."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-19 01:22:02):
And Iwao runs off into a tunnel.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-19 01:22:46):
Theron just laughs: 
"Ah good stuff.

Honestly the raptor was killing my good vibes, I'm glad he's dead."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-20 23:16:17):
Theron:
"Well, what if I said it'll take 3 days?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-05-20 23:34:48):
"If that won't convince you then we could also just kill you which in turn it would anger your god and blame you for your failure of achieving nothing!"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-05-20 23:36:55):
"I promise you Theron, anger me more and my kind will wipe from the face of Golarion every follower of your usurper god!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-24 23:53:26):
Theron turns to towards the North and nods, a calm comes over him, he now looks serious.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-24 23:53:52):
Theron:
"I, Theron, Theron Nyamat Mshwe, offer my complete and full surrender."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-24 23:54:22):
Theron closes his eyes and a grey glow covers his body for a moment.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-24 23:57:47):
Theron:
"The vault is almost unlocked.
I have released the physical; now only the spiritual lock remains."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-25 00:02:20):
Theron:
"The waters of the plaza of the gorilla god must be drunken to bond to this place.
Though..."

Theron looks at Tiny.

Theron:
"...I am not sure if any of you have the capacity to speak to the Gorilla God."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-25 00:02:46):
>> - Tarsus Longstaff. @buffetraider

>> - Leilani Kana. @HistoricallyInaccurate
>> - Lorn. Horia. @Nemesiux 
>> - Tiny. @errror01 
>> - Fierce Leopard. @RyoYamakawa

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-05-25 02:46:58):
Leopard approaches, panting softly as he comes down the emotional and physical toll of combat and the rush of emotions tied up in that. His gaze follows the old man's  before shifting it back to the cult leader. 
"Do you have to 'speak' with the Gorilla God to open the vault?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-25 02:56:51):
Theron:
"I am no longer the one who may open the spirit lock."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-05-25 02:59:23):
"But would one of us have to be able to do so to open it? Or is there something else to opening the spirit lock?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-05-25 12:22:57):
Lorn does a deep sigh and raises his hand

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-05-25 12:23:44):
"I am willing to do it if necessary. I already died once. You lot still have a life to live"

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-05-25 13:43:07):
"Well from what i got from that gorilla demon lord, maybe you don't even need to die. We might be able to pay the 'price' by fighting something?"
Looking back at Theron he'll pull out a rope and say:
"We'll need to tie this on you"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-27 02:35:42):
Theron shrugs:
"I am not scared of the past, I live for the future."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-05-27 20:33:13):
What next? :)

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-05-28 05:10:31):
"We could also leave him tied up with Dhira and Tavik. They're less likely to murder him or worse while we figure things out and get it done and they're right here so we don't have to trek through the facility to get him taken care of. Maybe we should gag him too, just to be safe."
