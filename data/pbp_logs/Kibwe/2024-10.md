**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2024-10-01 01:47:19):
Tarsus shakes his head, relieving some tension and calming down a bit.
"As much as I hate to see the parts that ARE gnoll bones defaced like that, it's not like there's anything I can do about it. And Lorn's still using them either way."
He gestures towards the door leading away from the butcher's chamber. 
"You said there was a way to deactivate the security measures if we take this path?"

Ademe continues:

"The layout of this place is strange as of course it was originally an experimental laboratory for dangerous, weird magics.

They never intended this room to be a guest room as much as the previous room was never intended to keep a host of magical flies."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-10-11 18:05:54):
So what happens next? :)

So what happens next? :)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-10-16 17:39:11):
Daichi goes up to where the panel is supposed to be and will run his hand against the wall to try and find it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-10-19 13:07:07):
Almost a critical failure.

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2024-10-19 13:36:52):
Tiny has trap finder, he should get a check if there is a trap

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-10-20 01:19:57):
Speaking of, since Isaac is rolling for traps can I roll for the button itself. Not going to press it, just find it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-10-20 01:37:56):
You find a well hidden detection panel, if you had opened the door, you'd have exploded.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-10-20 01:38:07):
Would you like to roll to disable?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-10-20 01:38:18):
Or take 20 minutes to take a 20 and slowly disable it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-10-29 01:44:18):
What next? :)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-10-29 04:51:51):
/roll 1d20+12

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-10-29 04:52:03):
Daichi tries to dissable the wiring using his infiltrator tools

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-10-31 04:43:25):
The detection panel is not triggered but you were very, very close to causing it to blast.
