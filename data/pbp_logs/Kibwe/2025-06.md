"Then let's knock him out, tie him up, and Tavik can sit on him or something.  We don't have time to waste on this 'meat bag' as you put it."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-06-04 16:36:48):
Lorn responds "As you wish. The term 'meat bag' is a popular insult in the necril language when speaking to a living being"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-06 03:09:05):
Just a reminder: we are out of initiative.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-06-06 10:18:45):
Lorn tries to contact Aderme regarding Theron's fate

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-07 21:08:29):
10 minutes pass and Ademe arrives.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-08 01:57:01):
Ademe looks to you Lorn:
"What do you need of me, my angel?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-08 19:58:29):
Ademe:
"Theron Nyamat Mshwe."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-08 20:56:52):
Ademe:
"I must thank you for the tablets.
I shall be taking them along with whatever else I wish from this place."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-08 20:59:14):
Theron Nyamat Mshwe:
"Take what you want.
I've won you know.
This was but one of the battles, a skirmish before it all starts.
You've heard it, the drums of war.

Your masters may have keen insights into the past but they are completely blind to the future.

....or did the whispers of the snake not see what lays before them."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-08 21:00:23):
Ademe seems very calm until that last sentence flies into a rage, in a blink at Theron's throat with a dagger:
"You know not the suffering of my people."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-08 21:01:18):
Theron Nyamat Mshwe seems unbothered by the blade to his throat and smiles a cool, sinister smile:
"And you said you wouldn't interfere?
I suppose rock candy over there changed things, hmm?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-08 21:03:20):
Ademe looks at Lorn, her eyes filled with an unknowable expression, something between bewilderment and curiousity.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-06-08 21:10:37):
"He willl be forced to see how the succubus will slowly hollow out his son soul in the future just for him to become a meal for my family"

**Hazel** (2025-06-10 05:06:45):
As the this conversation happens, the party will see a figure walking towards them at a brisk pace.

While talking she will look at each of you in turn, almost studying you. "Greetings, I believe you seem to be the adventurers I was sent to aid in acquiring this statue of curse breaking. My name is Farai, and I was sent by the city of Kibwe, to ensure the survival of it's people."

Farai is a dark skinned Samsaran, who holds themselves almost regally straight, but moves with a fluid grace that makes her seem to almost float. She's draped in brightly blue and green coloured, very loose and flowing robes and wraps, with an excess of material at her sleeves and waist/skirt area; she holds no visible weapon.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-18 12:42:10):
What next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-18 12:42:29):
We are not in encounter mode.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-20 16:52:32):
Farai coughs into her hand.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-20 16:52:38):
Farai coughs some more.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-20 16:52:39):
and more.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-20 16:53:01):
Farai looks up, about to speak then explodes, turning into a slime monster.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-20 16:53:47):
The monster does not seem immediately aggressive to the party due to its low intelligence.

However, it certainly is a threat.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-22 16:23:53):
Eda "Curse Breaker" Stone-Worth:
"What should we do to deal with this creature?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-22 16:31:41):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-22 17:02:51):
What next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-23 19:46:19):
What next? :)

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-06-26 17:06:39):
"Farai! Hold up! You're moving too quick..." Says a well-equipped, blonde-haired elf wearing a green armored tunic and a strange green hat rounding the corner. 
He arrived just in time to witness Farai explode into the slime. 
"BY THE GODDESSES!" he exclaims loudly. "I have never seen a Chuchu do that!"
Almost instantaneously, a gleaming sword is drawn in his left hand, and an impossibly polished shield is held up in his right.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-06-27 15:08:51):
Kieran almost didn't notice that he was being spoken to. His gaze affixed to the slime before him. Once everything processed, he responds.
"To be honest, I barely knew her. We were both simply selected at the same time to assist."
He inches closer, steeling himself. 
"But no one should have to suffer a fate such as that. I assume the change is permanent?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-28 00:22:25):
We are not in combat, just to be clear.

**Eimer Hone** (2025-06-28 01:08:16):
“That thing’s dangerous, even if it doesn’t know it. If Farai’s gone… then mercy means putting an end to it quickly. If we hesitate, people will die.”Turning to Kieran. “Decide fast, are you swinging that sword, or staying back?”

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-06-28 01:28:36):
A solemn look falls upon Kieran's face. 
"I understand."
He lunges forward, swinging his glinting blade in a wide arc at the slime, determined to finish it swiftly.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-30 04:00:40):
The slime ruptures your spleen. @HistoricallyInaccurate

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-30 04:00:46):
26 points of damage.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-30 04:01:03):
Then misses you on a 2nd strike.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-06-30 04:01:05):
