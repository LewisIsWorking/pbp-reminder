**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-10 03:49:51):
Lorn, Daichi Kenshin, Cliff Chewstick, Padraig Dream-Soup, Gringles Snotbelly and Eda 'Curse Breaker' Stonesworth stand by your side.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-10 03:53:15):
This room is filled with many low tables, each covered in deep platters of slabs of wet, blood meaty of a variety of colours.

Each slab of meat is soaking in its own juices.

To the North is another double door of ancient wood and old crumbling stone.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-10 03:54:01):
Would you like to proceed onward, through this Northern door or back track to the South?

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-05-10 14:09:21):
Onward to the N. doors

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-05-10 14:22:34):
I'll also go towards the Northern doors.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-15 19:54:21):
The group open the door, and find the primary supply room of the facility.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-15 19:54:31):
A few precariously stacked tables contain bedrolls, ropes,
cooking pots, and other supplies suitable for a lengthy
and arduous expedition.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-15 19:55:03):
This room contains a variety of supplies that could be used for excursions into the jungle surrounding the ancient fiend city.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-15 19:55:34):
A lot of the equipment requires some repairing, maintenance and/or
cleaning.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-15 19:56:21):
*[image]* At the western end of the room is a door.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-15 19:57:51):
Padraig Dream-Soup's +15 in perception is enough to notice something strange about the pile of equipment.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-15 19:58:16):
Does anyone in the group want to roll a perception roll for him?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-05-15 19:59:01):
/roll 1d20+15 (perception check)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-15 20:01:00):
What happens next?

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-05-15 20:01:51):
Open it

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-05-15 20:03:36):
Daichi will cast detect magic first

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-05-15 20:05:52):
Daichi will try to identify the magic with his arcane knowledge and discourages pad from opening the chest before the magic is identified.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-05-15 20:06:54):
/roll 1d20+11

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-05-15 20:09:06):
"Well I don't get what it is someone else wants to try?" Daichi says.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-05-15 20:33:36):
Lorn  opens it

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-15 21:38:28):
Lorn appeared to have frozen for a second, and then a brilliant light glows across his skeletal arm.

As the light fades, there is now a green flesh-like arm grown atop the skeletal arm.

You are partially alive.
Your arm is at least.

The voice of the curse breaker tells you:
"My creators knew how to bring life to undeath, 
in this era, you are the 2nd to receive such a blessing,
Philip the jester was the first so the networks of magic have spoken to me.
With it, you shall know no harm and wield my power."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-15 21:38:35):
Lorn you have a slime-flesh arm.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-05-15 22:09:53):
Cool now what?

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-05-15 22:18:51):
Open the next door?

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-05-15 22:33:09):
yeah

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-05-15 22:33:28):
yeah with my slime moonbear

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-05-15 22:52:46):
Lorn takes that stuff

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-05-15 23:29:36):
and now next room

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-05-15 23:33:45):
"I guess that works... Let's continue and be on the lookout for any ghouls"

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-05-15 23:34:15):
Daichi will continue to the west door.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-05-15 23:35:04):
And open it carefully just in case there are enemies behind.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-05-15 23:53:07):
/roll 1d20+11

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-05-16 00:12:31):
Show me Lorn character sheet and also level him to the party level please

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-05-16 01:52:23):
/roll 1d20+13

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-16 01:57:37):
This is a multi-purpose room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-16 01:58:06):
North west: there is a strange red brick wall, with weird magical runes.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-16 01:58:31):
Along the walls are more holy symbols, carved into the stone walls.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-16 01:59:05):
Spaced along the walls of the room are several mirrors, looking into the mirrors shows live footage of random points of the holy lost city you find yourself in.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-16 01:59:40):
There are long stone support beams that go crisscross the ceiling of the room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-16 02:00:20):
These beams have several corpses hanging on rope from them.
Each one contains a corpse, with the noose ending in the corpse.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-16 02:01:35):
Each corpse has skin the purple of a livid bruise and another strange rune adorning their bare chests.

They look ghoul-like, but different from normal ghouls, they have moss growing on their flesh.

These ghouls were clearly murdered then hung, tattooed and then scarred.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-05-16 04:01:30):
"Hey Lorn just in case wana try to shoot one of these down to check if they are dead dead? Cause I don't think we got those trinkets to fight ghouls that are already dead dead."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-05-16 10:42:35):
Lorn shoots them

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-05-16 19:41:46):
Lorn shots the other ghouls

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-05-16 21:05:07):
"well that's reassuring. Now let's check these runes" Daichi slowly walks up to the wall until he is at a good distance to decypher the runes.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-28 11:35:32):
The runes on the wall.

It seems to be like notes, notes pointing to a symbol:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-28 11:35:32):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-28 11:35:32):
This symbol has been scratched at and attempted to be painting over, covered, etc.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-28 11:35:32):
The symbol seems to have slowly dissolved anything touching it, acidic to the touch perhaps?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-28 11:35:32):
Besides that there seems to be many, many notes craved into the wall next to the original symbol.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-05-28 11:35:32):
So, what happens next?
