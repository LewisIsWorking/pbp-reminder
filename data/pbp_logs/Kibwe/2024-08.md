Would the fierce leopard like to use "you're next"?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-08-18 19:28:44):
Eda "Curse Breaker" Stones-worth sprints around the corner, joining you all in the room.

Eda says:
"I got the others to the cart at the entrance, they are holding off the city's fiends and jungle monsters that may approach the facility, and of course I can't let you all save me yourselves!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-08-18 19:39:51):

Since I can only get to the door with my full movement I'll go last so I don't block LoS or anything.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-08-18 23:42:59):
@tinysliney 

Eda unleashes an eldritch shot, and a powerful explosion of needles rains down on the back of the fleeing cultist, killing him immediately, torn flesh splashing the ground.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-08-18 23:43:30):
END OF COMBAT.

He then strides twice to get closer

Eda's turn:
At the start of Eda's turn Daichi will use his hero action Surge of speed to quicken Eda
Eda will move with her quickened action to have line of sight of the cultist
She devises a stratagem as a free action since the cultist is related to the slime incident(rolled a 17)
She then uses an eldritch shot infused with needle darts that critically hits the cultist and deals 31 damage from the initial shot + 26 damage and 5 bleed damage from the auto crit of needle darts

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-08-18 23:56:24):
Around the corner, moments after the battle, this woman comes around the corner:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-08-18 23:56:39):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-08-19 00:02:48):
The woman has long hair, with some of it with bobbles and bands holding it out of her face.

Some of her hair is well-kept and brushed, while some of the other segments of her hair are unkempt and messy.

She is a Mwangi woman with large green eyes that glow with some sort kind of magical energy.

She wears a long, flowing grey dress that cuts off just above the knee.

Underneath her dress, upon her legs, she wears a much more practical navy-grey trouser.

Underneath her dress, upon her chest is a beautiful ruffled vest that is a little too ruffled, it is crinkled and messy.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-08-19 00:03:52):
She curtsies to the group, glances at the dead splintered body of the cultist, and shrugs, and sits, sitting far enough from the blood splatters. 

She sits, cross-legged on the ground.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-08-19 00:04:43):
She speaks with a posh and refined, her accent is a mix of a Mwangi and something else, something from very far away:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-08-19 00:05:48):
"I am Ademe.

Congratulations on your victory.

What brings you to this facility?

Are you perhaps here for the statue.... or me?"

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2024-08-19 00:07:21):
Once everyone has moved into the next room, Tarsus will cast gale blast to push the flies away from the door and quickly shut it behind him.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-08-19 00:08:21):
Ademe stands up, sits on a massive bed, once again cross-legged:

"Please come in, it will be hard to speak with flies and blood filling your mouths."

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2024-08-19 00:19:27):
"were here for the loot.. er stature or something" Tiny looks at the others "are we supposed to kill everything we see?"

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2024-08-19 00:20:08):
Tarsus nods. "More or less,  we're after the statue that was taken from Kibwe. I don't think we really expected to find a luxury suite in the middle of this. Is this a gilded cage or are you here of your own accord?"

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2024-08-19 00:20:56):
"Not everyone, no. Only the ones that try to kill us, Tiny."

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-08-19 00:25:46):
"We only apprehend the other ones"

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-08-19 00:40:09):
Daichi will do a perception check on this person to check for any odd thing/weapons/sings of (illusion) magic or shapechange.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-19 00:45:31):
Lorn does the same

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-08-19 00:46:57):
Eda does the same probably

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-08-19 00:49:21):
*[image]* 3 perception checks

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-19 01:00:18):
"Also how do your people know of my sire"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-19 01:22:03):
"In the common tongue it is Selenor"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-19 01:27:02):
"Is it because he is an oracle?"

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2024-08-19 01:27:13):
Tarsus wanders over towards the table laden with jewelry and precious stones. 
"Were you buying from the cult, or were they buying from you?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-19 01:32:56):
"My creator was raised by Pharasma worshipers"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-19 01:37:43):
"He became one after he came back from the Void"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-19 01:38:03):
"Seek my creator he knows"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-19 01:41:36):
"He is searching for new hunting grounds"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-19 01:41:48):
"And to help a friend/ally"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-19 16:33:51):
"It takes him one year ot less to grow and to gain access the next rank of spells while you take hundred of years to hit such a level"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-19 16:52:05):
"Knowledge is power too"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-19 16:54:25):
"If it weren’t, then Nethys would not have become a god, nor would liches have become more powerful with each piece of information they acquire."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-19 16:58:11):
"Whatever. What do you want from us?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-19 17:08:59):
"I can help you find my creator who in turn will guide to his step mother who is a high priestess. You want to decipher the plates she knows how. Selenor probably could since he was raised by them."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-19 17:09:54):
"In exchange you help us find a cure for the curse"  Lorn looks at Daichi "Right?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-19 17:11:12):
"Another option is the knowledge about necromancy. We learned much from the whispering way books. Although they are biased."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-19 17:12:56):
"Or if you consider stories knowlegde  I could tell you about my creation or my creator life story up to the moment of us choosing our own path.

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2024-08-20 04:48:12):
"as a fellow archeologist I can tell you are just trying to delay us with your fancy words, it's not that complex, if you want to live show us the loot."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-20 10:28:26):
"Only mortals worship gods since you see them as a something above humans, but they are not above us merely stronger yet mortal. We pay respects to those who earn our gratitude. That is why you feel her essence. We don't pray but offer gifts and say our thanks and move on with our lives."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-20 10:30:09):
"I have also one more condition if you allow me. If I decipher these plates I ask of you to share whatever information you have available about his mother with my creator. He will find you unless his father does."

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2024-08-20 23:20:21):
Tiny puts his ear and listens at the western door

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-20 23:39:03):
Lorn approaches Pharasma's items and does a religion check to find out about the secrets of Pharasma

@Nemesiux 

Lorn,
Your socketless eyes look over the ancient rune carved platters.

You understand these platters, better than you'd imagine.

There is a soft flash of light.
Standing next to you is a ghostly transparent ghostly grey Selenor, though not as you know him.

This Selenor is very slightly older, much more feminine and much more attractive in an uncomfortably alluring way.

You can see partially through this Selenor.

All along this ghostly grey form, he burns with a flickering, wild grey flame that dances maddeningly.

Much has he changed, but your 'father' is unmistakably himself.

It is clear now.
Selenor is guiding you.
Helping you read the plates.

You do not mention Selenor's presence as no member of the party except Eda seems to notice him, though Eda is trying her best not to say anything or make it obvious.

You explain all of the following aloud.

They are clearly Pharasmian magical items.

Based upon the style of their runes they are as old as at least the age of legend.

The platters each have a title.

The first is: Fear.
The second is Darkness.

Each platter will allow either a follower of Pharasma or a sin wielder to cast Fear/Darkness at their personal highest rank once per day.
Like a self upgrading wand.

As for the information they inscribe, it is particularly grim.

They seem to have been made by a priest of Pharasma during the age of legend.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-08-24 02:18:08):
"It just crossed my mind but you are human aren't you?
How come you're not a slime yet?
If you say you have been 'monitoring the experiment' as you call it you must've come into close contact at some point. 
Maybe you should hurry up and find a cure or you might become some sort of ooze yourself."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-24 02:36:46):
"This is not her true form. I tried to pierce her illusion, but I am still too weak to break it."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-24 13:50:27):
"Won't you like this curse-breaker to break your people curse"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-24 13:52:08):
"I assume this slime plague is similar to your people curse since you mentioned that your curse has the downside of causing your people to degenerate to a lesser form"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-24 14:30:21):
"All you need to do is hold your part of the deal.... or else my father will hunt you down in order to obtain that information about his mother. He is now aware of your existence."

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2024-08-24 14:33:17):
"so no stab?" tiny says confused, "Got a hard mind, good for crushing too"

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-08-26 12:39:39):
"Well I guess you're free to go for now after you answer those questions we got more pressing matters than dealing with you anyways.
Is cursebreaker here and where exactly is it?
Where is the key to the secret door on the north west room or if there is no key how to open it?
"

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-08-26 12:47:28):
"And what about the door in the middle at the entrance that just goes west? It also leads to the same place in the end?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-26 13:04:20):
"By magi tech do you mean sin magic or Numerian techmagic?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-08-26 17:04:04):
"Just like Pharasma he has a goal beyond the petty goals of the afterlife planes, he desires for all of us necrotic shells to regain what the positive plane stole from us.... our free will... our souls."
