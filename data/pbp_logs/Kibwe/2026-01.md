**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:02:09):
You approach the city.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:02:32):
As you come towards the massive towering rune-carved ancient walls of Kibwe, you see the guard towers are not guarded.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:03:11):
Instead, large slimes have filled the guard towers, forming massive slimes covered in the defensive walls of the walls themselves.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:03:49):
Tal'lysae:
"We shall avoid these threats to save your strength."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:05:28):
The party now follow Tal'lysae for over 30 minutes, walking around the walls.

Outside the walls of Kibwe are not all desolate across the entire circumference of the city, there are small hamlets, stables, markets scattered outside around the walls. 

All of these structures lay destroyed and/or deserted.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:07:12):
Tal'lysae takes you to a service trapdoor, opening it with a loud THUNK.

Tal'lysae climbs down the steel ladder and leads the party through the service tunnel.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:08:36):
Even here in the arid heat of the dry service tunnel, slime leaks in small drips and drabs through the ceiling, forming tiny-tiny slime organisms crawling along the ground.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:11:07):
Tal'lysae moves forward with a familiarity that seems...unnatural for someone who has never been here before.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:12:04):
The party arrive at a large stone door, locked by a magical rune.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:12:24):
Tal'lysae:
"Are any of you masters of Thievery?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:15:09):
Eda Stone-Worth, The Curse Breaker, without saying anything, moves forward, clicks their finger, and the stone door turns to ash.

Eda Stone-Worth, The Curse Breaker, without turning, says:

"The temple is calling me.

I must go swiftly."

Eda Stone-Worth, The Curse Breaker, LEAPS forward into the light of the outside world with EXTREME speed.

Within a few seconds, Eda is easily 100s of metres away.

There is no way for the group to outpace Eda unless you have very, very high speed or teleportation.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:16:00):
The party walk into the light of the city of Kibwe.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:16:15):
You see, as your eyes adjust to the harsh light: DISASTER.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:16:18):
What greets you is a city transformed.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:16:26):
The streets, once bustling with merchants and travelers from across Garund, are nearly empty.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:17:05):
Some corpses litter the way, all non-humans.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:17:11):
No humans in sight.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:17:22):
Shops are shuttered.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:17:28):
Market stalls stand abandoned, goods rotting in the humid air.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:17:35):
A child's doll lies in the gutter, half-dissolved into translucent goo.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:17:55):
Somewhere distant, a scream cuts off with a wet, bubbling gurgle, another citizen transforming, no doubt.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:18:27):
Besides that the sound of burning buildings crackle around you all.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:19:54):
Tal'lysae points at the golden dome in the far distance, poking its top above the other buildings of the city:
"There. The Sun Temple awaits."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:20:20):
Between the party and the Sun Temple lies a city in chaos.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2026-01-08 06:20:53):
"This is worse than I could have imagined. How could it have progressed so quickly?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 06:56:10):
Tal'lysae:
"If I had to take a guess...

Paga Nikohian is in the Sun Temple right now."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 07:34:43):
The party continue forward.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 07:36:08):
As the party moves through one of Kibwe's wide merchant streets, you see a human merchant tugging frantically on the reins of his beast of burden.

The beast is a massive Triceratops with garish crimson and gold stripes painted along its frill. 

The wagon behind the dinosaur groans under an absurd load: 

crates of trade goods, rolled carpets, and brass automatons still in their shipping frames.

Probably everything the merchant owns, apparently.

The sick, slime-dripping human merchant screams at the Triceratops:
"Move, you stubborn bitch! MOVE!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 07:36:23):
The merchant strikes the dinosaur across its snout with a weighted crop. 

Once. 

Twice. 

The third blow lands...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 07:36:33):
And his arm dissolves.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 07:36:37):
The transformation is horrifyingly fast.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 07:36:46):
His skin ripples, turns translucent, then sloughs away entirely as his body collapses into a stinking mass of sewage-brown slime.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 07:36:50):
The triceratops screams.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 07:37:04):
Not a roar.
A scream, almost human in its terror.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 07:37:10):
The slime splashes across its legs and underbelly as it thrashes, snapping its harness with a sound like breaking bones.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 07:37:22):
The wagon tips.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 07:37:27):
A grandfather clock shatters.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 07:37:31):
One of the brass automatons activates on impact and begins walking in confused circles, gears grinding.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 07:37:34):
The triceratops rounds on the nearest targets: you.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-08 07:37:53):
Unless someone can calm down the triceratops, it is about to attack the group!

**None** (2026-01-08 16:00:21):
A dwarf wearing a midnight blue robe with a grey spiraling comet on the front partially covered by a chain shirt approaches from around a corner and walks towards the beast.  A hawk sits on his shoulder. He whispers to the Triceratops to try and calm it as he slowly and carefully approaches.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-08 17:47:15):
Keiran's bow is raised, aimed at the beast, a steely look in his eyes. Globs of slime drip from his outstretched arm, plopping on the ground. Each time, shortly after, the globs will slide back into his main body. 

He maintains his posture, ready to defend the group as necessary, but waits to see the results of this dwarf's whisperings.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 12:20:20):
Everyone roll nature.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 12:20:46):
This will be an extremely difficult task.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 21:25:21):
A nearby Pharasman Dwarf of unclear and inpatient origins leaps towards the dinosaur in an effort to calm the beast. 

The dwarf, reaching for his holy symbol seems uninterested in helping nor associating with the heroes, instead attempting to solo it. 

Unfortunately the dwarf's leaping battle cry ends in the dinosaur lowering his horn defensively. 

The dwarf becomes impaled and the slime-merchant immediately reacts.

The slime merchant creates a slippy sloppy appendage & grabs the struggling (going pale) impaled body of the dwarf. 

Then.... 
As the arm makes contact... 

Something strange happens.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 21:26:01):
The dwarf explodes in a ball of white light. 

The dark green slime EVOLVES, absorbing....

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 21:27:38):
Tal'lysae:
"His divine spirit! 
No. No. No. No. No." 

Tal'lysae:
"You have been gone for days, but...."

Tal'lysae vibrates:
"That's not supposed to happen. 
The odds of... 
The flame shouldn't..."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 21:28:57):
The glowing bright blinding light of the merchant slime diss down somewhat and where 3 entities once stood now only the triceratops and the... 

WHITE FLAME MERCHANT SLIME REMAIN. 

The slime is bigger. 
Stronger. 
Glowing. 
The dwarf's corpse is deeply rooted into the core of the slime.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 21:29:21):
Unlike the merchant's corpse, which was disintegrated, the dwarf is embedded into the slime like a battery.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 21:29:35):
Tal'lysae:
"That's not how this was supposed to go...."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 21:30:41):
Lorn. 
@Nemesiux 

You sense familiar energies. 

You sense an almost kinship with this slime. 

You sense your father, Selenor. 

It's as if this slime is his cousin. 

Your.... Cousin once removed.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 21:30:57):
This encounter (for some reason) has changed.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-16 21:31:28):
The greater threat of the triceratops has become lessened as even the dinosaur is scared, the DC to calm him significantly decreased.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-22 18:32:43):
So, what happens next?

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2026-01-22 18:43:43):
Can you roll for me please

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2026-01-22 18:43:49):
I am not at the PC

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-22 19:06:11):
*[image]* Keiran attempts to place himself between the beast and this new form of slime. He does so with as much care as he can muster, hoping that the dinosaur will understand he is trying to protect him.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 16:41:09):
Kieran's careful approach works.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 16:44:20):
The Triceratops stares at Kieran.

Then Triceratops fixes its terrified eyes on the glowing White Flame Slime.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 16:44:39):
Kieran. Your slime form quivers.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 16:44:55):
Kieran feels like he can sense the thoughts of the dinosaur.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 16:45:15):
The beast recognises something in the merchant-dwarf-white-flame-slime.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 16:46:00):
Not a threat. 

Not another master with a weighted crop.

Something else.

The Triceratops may not understand this new foe but...

The dinosaur stamps once. 

Twice. 

Then lowers its massive painted frill, trembling but no longer panicking.

It won't attack.

It waits.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 16:46:08):
The White Flame Slime has no such hesitation.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 16:48:10):
Tal'lysae's voice cuts sharply through the situation:

"Lorn.
Others.
It is unstable.

The divine spirit was not meant to merge this way.
 It will lash out at anything it perceives as a threat.

We must destroy it before it grows stronger; it WILL grow stronger.

It will consume and consume and consume, more and more and more.

Divine spirits know NO bounds, they have no limits."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 16:48:18):
The White Flame Slime surges forward towards the group.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-26 16:48:20):
COMBAT!

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-26 16:53:33):
Kieran's divine spark will shift into his shield.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-01-28 13:57:38):
Just beyond the group stood a lone figure dressed in travel robes and wearing a large hat to shade from the sun stood a black feathered Tengu.  He watched for a few moments and seeing what was transpiring placed a right hand on his Gale Blade to free it as he moved forward to lend assistance as needed.  As he moved forward there was a flash of light periodically from  his left hand as something caught and reflected the light.

Lorn looks at Tal'lysae "if that being is one of us can't we tame it or calm it down? Perhaps if we offer it a part of our flame it might work."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-28 17:02:16):
*[image]* Kieran gazes upon the creature, looking for a weakness, but the sight of the 'battery' within its form makes his body shudder in unease. He finds himself distracted.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2026-01-28 17:03:12):
*[image]* Although he is unable to find a weak spot yet, he knows his duty is to his party and he rushes forward to land a strike.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-28 18:39:02):
The slime is not afraid.

*[image]* As the flames of rage settle it turns to a chilling aura, with a ghostly flame radiating from him. He moved towards the slime, brandishing his flail and shield. As he reaches his target he strikes out with his weapons, his flail making solid contact while the shield hits hard.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-01-29 03:04:22):
Master Cho with a sqwak reaches to the many dangling bits and bobs pulling out some salt to dust his sword as he attempts to exploit vulnerability on the giant slime.  (focusing on his innate desire to make a good impression with his allies Hero point reroll) "Slime like being, it is best to not let you spread your wickedness and thus I bind you with salt."  Once his Gale blade is dusted he rushes forward to the rear of the creature and flurries his sword at it.  His first strikeshits with a resounding schlap while his 2nd strike  slides off the slick form, still doing some damage. The body of the creature quivers as stunning energy whips through it.

**Bruce/Ravnos1 | Chua Datafang SF** (2026-01-29 03:04:34):
*[image]* lore check against its level

**Path Wars** [GM] (2026-01-29 10:04:22):
^ Please everyone pause this for today as I need to apply the critical effects from Fierce Leopards attacks.
