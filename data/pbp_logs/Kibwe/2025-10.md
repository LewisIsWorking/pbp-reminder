The portal closes behind you all.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-04 01:33:04):
*[image]* Sort of like this, but without the water.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-04 01:33:10):
And taller walls :3

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-10-06 00:50:31):
Approaches Eda and the slime woman carefully, curious what is happening and what is being said.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-11 01:15:12):
The party approaches.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-11 01:16:13):
The red slime woman is not like the slimes you have fought.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-11 01:16:22):
She appears made of a solid blood form.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-11 01:16:44):
She is just about transparent enough to see her bones glistening like in jelly.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-11 01:17:09):
Eda Stone-Worth (The Curse Breaker), of course, towers over the red slime woman.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-11 01:18:58):
She also has eyes. Bright yellow eyes.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-11 01:19:57):
Tal'lysae:
"I am Tal'lysae.
I have travelled across the skin of reality and through the web of time to speak to you all.
I...I was saved from a most terrible fate."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-11 01:21:35):
Eda Stone-Worth continues to gaze down at the red slime woman, Tal'lysae:
"Your magics are....strange.
Older than the old ways, yet.... 
You are not perfect.
Broken then stitched together into something almost entirely new, not poorly but imperfect.


How can you have magics that far predate me?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-11 01:30:12):
Tal'lysae does not answer this question, instead looking at the wider group:
"You have already made great and powerful decisions that will echo across what little time is left for this world.

I wish to help.

Your cause is not hopeless. 

Curse breaker's magics, though one of the greatest curse-cleansing magics in reality, lack the charge, the time and the precision to fully cleanse the populace.

You will save them with your slime pact magic and your curse-breaking. 

Both humans and non-humans will be...."

Tal'lysae looks at Akuma and Akwa:
"...different.
Not bad. 
Different.

I wish to assist you.

Afterwards, you will have a city of ruin and chaos.

Enter into an alliance with me, and I shall use my knowledge of magics to protect the city and its populace. 

Furthermore, I will ensure the curse does not worsen nor spread beyond the walls of the city.

There are hundreds of thousands of people who will become curse-ridden."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-11 01:31:20):
Eda Stone-Worth looks at the group:
"I cannot say if they speak the truth, but it is true, my connection to Kibwe is severed, I must use my place of rest, the temple of the sun, to reconnect."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-10-13 16:53:53):
Although Kieran is okay with change, even forcing it upon others if it would save lives, he finds himself a bit more hesitant. She said the city would fall into ruin and chaos. Which was what he had hoped to avoid by bringing back Eda. 
He looks at the slime Eda, and ponders a bit more. He wonders what his allies think of this situation and the offer.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-10-13 20:01:26):
Lorn looks with determination at the red slime woman "If I accept to be your ally will you offer information on who these   grey and green flame forces are?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-10-13 20:02:04):
"Or to help my priestess with lifting her people's curse

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-10-13 20:04:58):
"After we help the people of Kibwe."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-10-13 20:19:55):
Lorn looks at Ademe "Do you agree as well?"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-10-20 02:43:51):
"I'm not so sure about all this. What do you mean by 'little time is left for this world'? I can't help but find this to be quite ominous."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-10-20 08:17:09):
Lorn turns towards (ryo's character) "she is refering to doomsday. We only have a couple years"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-10-20 08:47:35):
Leopard pauses before turning his head to look at Lorn. "Excuse me? Actually no, no time for explanations unless it involves working out how to stop that from happening."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-10-22 16:24:59):
Kieran looks among the group, his body dripping the occasional glob of goo that pulls itself back into his current shape. "Are we doing this?" 
He looks back down at Eda, watching her make blop and slop sounds, and he thinks about the choices he has made, the sacrifices he has made. Having this moment to reflect is something he wishes he did not have.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-23 00:25:49):
Tal'lysae:
"As my divine spirit died, he chose me, he SAVED me to become one of his angels."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-10-23 00:39:16):
Kieran looks at the red woman and then back at the Eda in his hand. "Tell me, gramps, who is that woman?" He does not say it out loud; he thinks it, assuming this connection works both ways. "I have not sided with anyone quite yet, but time is short and information is limited."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-10-23 01:52:39):
Pidge adds:

"Well. At least that's who I think she works for."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-10-23 08:37:53):
Lorn with a more serious look "I saw my father death.. the door... you opened it didn't you?! That is why you lost your divine status  right?"

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-10-23 17:15:02):
Kieran allows the words to echo in his mind for a moment, replaying them, analyzing them. "If we choose not to become servants to a world ender, we may still have ten years to come up with a solution for whatever this far worse fate is?"

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-10-23 17:21:54):
There is a somewhat shocked expression on Kieran's face as he realizes he spoke that final question instead of 'thinking' it like he had intended. 

He looks at Lorn and then the red slime woman, and tries to formulate words that wouldn't put them all at jeopardy. "No, not her." He attempts to lean in a bit closer to Lorn to whisper, "but her savior?" He leans back and shrugs while staring at her seriously, giving a slight nod in the process.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-10-23 17:30:06):
Lorn searches through the pile of information in his mind that he received from his father and then says "He has a father who from time to time speaks to him as well as a grandfather with whom he never got to interact.
Are you an angel created by the grandfather or my father's father?"

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-10-23 17:47:47):
"If something else is going to come along in ten years, I'd rather not be dealing with the curse at the same time. May as well deal with what's in front of us so that we're ready for whatever comes next, especially knowing we have time to prepare."

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-10-23 17:54:43):
"We don't have as much information as we'd like, so tracking down the green flames or whatever that secret society calls themselves will be necessary at some point. If we accept this being's help with the curse we can resolve that more quickly and switch focus to gathering information."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-10-26 00:58:50):
"I agree. We can't be splitting our focus or something will slip through the cracks." Leopard shifts his pack on his back and grunts. "Let's deal with the curse. We might luck out and get some clues that help with our other problems, but even if we don't we have this shit done with."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-10-27 16:23:14):
There's a pit in Kieran's stomach; he never imagined Gramps to be shaken about anything. Yet, it seems everyone is concerned about finishing this up quickly, just as he was in the Temple. 
He feels they are about to owe a debt they cannot possibly pay. He only wishes there were more time. With that final thought, he steps forward. 
"What are the terms of this alliance?"
