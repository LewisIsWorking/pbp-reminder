**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-12-01 18:24:54):
The group travels downwards.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-12-01 18:29:40):
The walls start to have old steam values, many rusted and broken.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-12-01 18:31:09):
Occasionally big puffs of steam blast out from the walls, barely missing your faces, singeing several hairs, burning some flesh lightly.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-12-01 18:32:29):
The bottom of the stairs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-12-01 18:32:55):
You find yourselves in a long one way corridor.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-12-01 18:36:35):
It is dominated by more valves, gauges, etc.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-12-01 18:36:39):
What happens next?

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2024-12-01 18:37:21):
/roll 1d20+12

**Eimer Hone** (2024-12-02 17:14:03):
“Let’s go ahead if there is no danger,” Leilani says hesitantly.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-12-03 02:06:34):
Leopard starts to make his way down the corridor, his shield up and ready and keeping his eyes open and nose sniffing looking for any dangers along the way.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-12-03 02:13:49):
What happens next? :)

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-12-03 02:23:11):
Anything noteworthy in terms of scents or noises coming from above? I will roll perception for the sounds if needed, but scents are automatic.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-12-06 09:08:50):
"So, should we scout ahead or just go on up blind?"

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2024-12-06 14:33:16):
"We should at least try not to attract attention once we're near the top, not that it's likely they'll hear us with all that noise going on. Must be some kind of forge up there."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-12-13 05:43:19):
"Ok, slow and as silent as possible. We don't need to be perfect with the noise going on, but just be careful with your steps and nothing above a whisper unless it's an emergency." He nods to the group before he takes the first steps up the stairs.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-12-16 03:16:17):
Whispering softly back he nods to the two elder members of the group. "Better to ask those two. Tiny, Taurus, and myself only just arrived a little earlier than you. We fought cultists and a demon or something though."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-12-19 14:37:33):
What happens next? 
:)

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-12-19 16:21:50):
Well, first off Leopard will check the door. Is it a relatively normal door or does it require some special method to open it? And either way, is it potentially trapped?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-12-19 16:27:55):
What happens next? 
:)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-12-19 16:54:21):
No.

This seems more like an alternative entry way.

**Eimer Hone** (2024-12-19 21:17:40):
Leilani steps forward and press the button panel. 

“What’s the worst thing that could happen. Just get ready.”

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-12-20 00:54:32):
Leopard grumbles slightly at the impatience of this new 'companion' before drawing his weapon and getting ready for what is beyond the door.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-12-20 04:00:51):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-12-20 04:00:52):
You enter into THE FORGE.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-12-20 04:01:11):
It seems like the dinosaur is trying to teach the chanting gorilla-like creature.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-12-20 04:09:11):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-12-20 04:09:25):

He will then attempt to trip it (19 fail).

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-12-23 16:55:31):
Eda's turn.
Since daichi lit up the room a bit more she will devise a stratagem as a free action(since these people are related to "the case of the slime morphing disease and the abduction of curse-breaker')

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-12-23 16:56:58):
She rolled a 5 so she will choose to use a skill stratagem.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-12-23 16:59:33):
She will "Recall knowledge" to see if the creature would have a weakness she could exploit. (Either a weakness to a certain type of damage or a weakness to it's defences(body fortitude, mental fortitude/will,reflexes)).
(Failed)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-12-23 17:20:09):
