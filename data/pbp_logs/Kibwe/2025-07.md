**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-03 04:03:36):
*[image]* Stepping into his swing, Kieran's sword starts to shine brightly as he attempts to make two strikes in quick succession against the slime.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-03 04:07:52):
*[image]* His combo strikes true as he unleashes his inner radiance into the blade, damaging the creature's spirit over it's flesh. The glow of his sword dims, and his shield begins to glimmer.

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-07-06 23:23:16):
*[image]* Tarsus shoves his spellbook back into his pack and runs into the fight. He imbues his staff with fire magic and swings it with both hands, spellstriking the slime with Ignite.
(1 action move, 2 actions spellstrike)
Critical hit!
22 bludgeoning (11*2) and 28 fire (14*2) damage, and persistent fire damage (can be dragged from spell description if it isn't dead yet)

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-07-06 23:23:39):
*[image]*

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-06 23:31:51):
*[image]* Leopard rushes into the fray, his flail at the ready and with a brutal swing he hit the first slime and the momentum of his strike swept through it's viscid body into the second. 

(No crit damage, but does trigger the crit effects of the weapon and the crushing rune. Need a Reflex save for both DC 22. Plus they are clumsy and enfeebled 1)

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-06 23:35:29):
(If they fail they are also prone... somehow.)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-06 23:42:50):
After Tarsus and Leopard attacks:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-06 23:43:44):
*[image]* At Death's Door.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-06 23:43:57):
*[image]* Not feeling good.

>> - Tiny. @errror01

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-06 23:58:22):
*[image]* Lorn's turn since @Nemesiux is 'busy':
1 action: Swap to phalanx piercer.
1 action: Enter the point blank stance
1 action: shoot the closest slime
(Although the weapon deals piercing damage it's a concussive weapon so it still damages the creature as much as a bludgeoning weapon would)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 00:05:56):
Lorn kills 1 slime.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 00:06:05):

SLIME'S TURN!

Characters who have yet to take their turn:

>> - Eda "Curse-Breaker" Stoneworth @MrNegetZ

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 00:50:52):
Eda blasts the slime with 2 force bolts.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 00:50:54):
It's dead.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 00:50:56):
COMBAT OVER!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 00:51:09):
+1 Hero Point to all Kibwe main characters.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 00:51:16):
You are back in exploration mode.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 00:51:31):
Ademe:
"Good job heroes."

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-07 00:51:51):
Daichi:
"  Now to get that door open."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-07 00:51:56):
Theron:
"Shame about your friend." 

Whilst looking at @Linksanelf2006

Ademe shoots Theron a glare.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-07 06:11:44):
Kieran replies with noticeable melancholy, "I appreciate it."

He looks at the group before him. "What's the status? Are we close to resolving this curse?"

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-07-07 08:00:20):
Tarsus grunts. "In terms of distance, yes. The 'supportive' one restrained over there is the ringleader of this whole ordeal, I wouldn't take his sympathy at face value. The door has been physically unlocked, but we still need to perform some ritual to gain access to the curse breaker. What risk that involves hasn't been made clear yet."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-07 18:50:08):
Ignoring the captive's snicker and Lorn's threat, Kieran tries to focus on the words of Tarsus and Eda. 

"So, let's get the ritual started if we can. From my experience, we are either favored or we are not."

He turns towards Tarsus and Eda, "What do we need to do? Do we need any materials or texts or what-have-you?"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-08 03:00:12):
Being a bit late with the group, having followed the noises, you see a well kempt, good looking, white-furred Kitsune woman enter the halls.  Behind her floats a large catfish-like creature with iridescent blue stripes running across its body. It seems to float through the air as if through water. 
You can see a symbol that looks like this: [水] on her forehead, the same on the head of the catfish.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-08 03:41:30):
Eda "Curse-Breaker" Stone-Worth:
"As far as I know, drinking from the dark waters of the demon pool will begin the ritual."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-08 14:30:46):
It took a bit longer to process the information regarding the demon pool as Kieran was clearly distracted by the fish that was swimming through the air. It seemed to be connected to the kitsune in some way due to the similar markings on their foreheads. He wasn't quite sure if these two were friend or foe, but he gave them a friendly wave nonetheless. 

After the gesture, Kieran heads to the dark body of water in the room and stares into it. "So, I drink this, and then what?" He asks as he kneels closer to the waters, preparing to cup his hands for a drink.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-08 15:04:07):
"Oh- there it is." 
The Kitsune says, slightly out of breath. She pats on her chest as if dusting off herself. 

She has heard rumors about the Demon Pool herself, is happy to have found it, but surprised to see other people there before her. 

"Looks like the rumors of the demon pool spread far." 

Slowly, she steps forward, her Eidolon following close behind her. 

"I don't mean any harm. Besides, I probably wouldn't be able to take you all." 

As a sign of her honesty, she flicks her tail and the catfish dissipates into a sparkle of water droplets.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-08 17:10:02):
"Hey there." Still staring into the pool. "I'm Kieran. Just arrived here myself."
He points to the restrained man, "Bad guy." Shifting his finger towards Eda and the others, "Good guys."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-09 00:56:19):
*[image]* (What does Akwa know about the Demon Pool?)

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-09 00:59:40):
Akwa looks towards Kieran. "My name is Akwa."
She steps forward, closer to the group.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-09 18:51:57):
*[image]* Kieran searches his mental library for information regarding the pool and its properties. (Kieran also has Demon Lore, and if it applies, please add 2 to the result)

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-09 22:39:26):
And dungeons

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-11 06:31:43):
What next? :)

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-11 22:56:03):
Did my check reveal anything?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-07-15 14:19:40):
If we don't get anything I'll throw Tiny @errror01 in there.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-16 09:34:45):
The dark pools contain a divine connection to the Demon God of Gorillas.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-16 09:35:05):
The black water seems to be magically charged.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-16 09:35:44):
This courtyard, the pillars of magic, the scars of experimental magic recycled for new purpose.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-16 09:35:52):
It's all to conduct ritual magic.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-16 09:36:13):
....and in this case, allowing this water to flow from the abyss to here.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-16 09:37:49):
This water is sent from the Abyssal realm of Ahvoth-Kor: the endless jungle of the rift.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-16 16:26:03):
Taking a deep breath, Kieran kneels down to the pool before him and scoops up some of the pool's "water". He stares deeply at it before lifting it to his mouth and taking a hearty gulp.

**Eimer Hone** (2025-07-17 10:05:56):
"Let's move forward. We came here for a job. Let's just get this done."

**Eimer Hone** (2025-07-17 10:11:47):
Leilani goes south towards the door of the vault

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 10:15:27):
It is a repurposed element of a long bygone era.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 10:15:44):
Once used by the empires of old to house... who knows what?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 10:15:55):
Experiments? Treasure? Dangerous equipment?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 10:17:00):
Now: 

10,000+ years later the vault is not quite what it was but it has been magically enchanted to tap into the ritual magic of this facility's new patron: the Gorilla 🦍 Demon God.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 10:17:36):
Leilani.

You are connected to Curse Breaker.

He brought you back to life.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 10:18:01):
Curse Breaker gave you the power of the Phoenix, the power of those who have risen again.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 10:18:11):
You can sense him on the other side of the vault door.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 10:18:17):
So close.

So very, very close.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 10:18:25):
Yet.
So far.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 10:18:32):
What would you like to do?

**Eimer Hone** (2025-07-17 10:22:18):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 10:23:03):
It's not possible to tell how those magical researchers of old would have opened this vault.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 10:23:15):
Perhaps with a spell, magical items, common word or key.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 10:23:39):
Now the vault's runic magic has been relinked to two connections:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 10:23:43):
Flesh and Blood.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 10:23:53):
The flesh is connected to Theron.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 10:25:04):
And Theron's connection is gone, he relinquished it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 10:25:41):
That leaves blood, it's clear that the ritual sacrifices over many years has granted a gift from the gorilla god.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 10:25:59):
A lock, sealed with the power of a demon lord.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-17 10:26:31):
How to release the seal is unclear.

But with your knowledge of nature it is clear to you that the process is non natural indeed.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 07:23:30):
The water sinks into the ground and you see the water level of the pool rise by proportionate amount.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 07:26:20):
Theron Nyamat Mshwe suddenly grins, laughs and YELLS:

"He is compatible!!!

But can he survive?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 07:29:08):
Ademe seems to have a moment of realisation as Theron Nyamat Mshwe says this, a look of understanding is written across Ademe's face.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 07:29:28):
Kieran.

You are falling through a dark void.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 08:13:33):
@Linksanelf2006

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-22 16:38:55):
Kieran attempts to take in his surroundings, a sense of unease pulsating through him as he notices movement of the water about him. He raises his shield (assuming it's there) in preparation for what may come.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-22 18:27:25):
The stone of the stand is dark black and slimy.

The book itself is thick and grotesque.

It looks like it is made of living black and green flesh, and is covered in dozens of eyes that currently watch you.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-22 22:04:54):
*[image]* Approaching the stand and book, Kieran attempts to recall any knowledge he may have about this situation. 
(I have an equal score in Arcana, Religion, and Nature as well. Demon and Dungeoneering Lore are 2 higher)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 06:58:06):
It looks cursed / bound / sealed / etc.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 06:58:44):
It seems this place is either a place to keep people away from the book... Or the book away from people.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 06:59:51):
The eyes of the book, the manifestation of the knowledge kept within: 
they look at you with an intense ever moving wiggling stare but not in a way that is necessarily aggressive but rather desperate.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 07:01:14):
You got a 30, which is a threshold number and a critical as well.

Normally impossible but, you have an opportunity.

You have enough knowledge that you could, if you wish, run your hand above the book and command the book to show you knowledge without unsealing the book.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 07:17:02):
If anyone else wants to RP the "out of water" reaction, feel free.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 07:17:08):
Also, if anyone wants to do *anything* else.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 07:17:10):
Just say.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 07:32:52):
Theron Nyamat Mshwe::
"The green flame has saved the world. Rejoice."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-23 07:45:48):
Meanwhile Akwa steps closer towards the pool, surprised to see one person suddenly turn into water themselves. 
Akwa focusses and summons her Eidolon again, it appears out of thin air, falling a bit and making a splash of water in a 10ft radius. (Nobody gets hit)

Then Akwa and Welsa, her Eidolon, also drink from the pool.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-23 07:47:23):
(Fuck. Still need to come up with something)

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-23 15:05:17):
"Cursed." Keiran mutters.

He is no stranger to curses, and he knows that they are not things to be taken lightly. 

Nonetheless, he stares intently back at the at the eyes, gritting his teeth in anticipation. His curiosity and desire to better understand curses draws him closer to the book. He barely even notices his own hand hovering above the tome.

"Tell me your sercrets..."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 15:08:00):
You see before you, the village.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 15:08:18):
The children lay surrounding you, dead, torn apart, blood splattered.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 15:08:36):
Tree: gnarled, rotten, burnt and chopped to pieces.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 15:08:39):
And finally:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 15:08:58):
Serena.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 15:09:19):
You see that unspeakable things have happened to Serena, it is all you can do to not be sick.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 15:09:48):
The book is showing you the future as is, but not what the future has to be.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-23 15:45:54):
Kierans face shifts from curiosity to fear, then from fear to disgust, and finally from disgust to rage. 

His body is tense and quivers involuntary, his eyes practically piercing the tome in front of him. 

He grabs the book, squeezing it as if he could choke the life from it. Kieran's eyes begin to swell with held back tears of anger. He soon realizes that it was not the book he was angry at, but rather himself. He was angry to see his own failure so vividly.

Now holding the book more gently, slowly calming down, he ponders on what he is to do next in this gods-forsaken place.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 16:07:00):
Now it asks you for something:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 16:07:02):
Open me.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 16:07:10):
Let us change the future.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-23 16:52:09):
The request makes Kieran freeze up. Every fiber of his being screams It's a trap! It has to be. The book literally resides within the 'Demon Pool'. How could it not be a trap?
He looks out into the void around him, confirming what he already knew. There is nothing in this place. Only him and the book. 
He takes in a deep breath. He knows that there is only two paths before him. He either opens the book or he dies here. If he opens the book, there is no knowing what is released. It could be a great good, or more likely, a greater evil. If he chooses to deny the tome's request, he will perish here. There will be no one to save his village.
The book is now opened. It was almost as if his body knew what he was ultimately going to decide. If an evil is released here, he will stop it. But regardless, he cannot leave his village to it's fate.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 16:59:08):
The book starts to drip slime down to the water, the water sizzles and burns at the contact with the book's juices.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 16:59:17):
The book flicks to the middle pages.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 17:02:10):
Upon it's nearly black pages, bright green text writes itself across the page:

"Kieran.
Let's save the village.
Let's save Kibwe.
Let's save the world.

The prophecy of your birth was passed down from a text from the holy lost city.

This book.

Speak the words."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 17:02:34):
The book flicks to the end.

Where ritual words are etched into the page, in blue spidery lettering.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-23 17:25:45):
Slightly hesitant, yet determined, Kieran recites the words that appear on the page.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 17:28:59):
The book transforms into an inactive gateway.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 17:32:27):
The gateway activates.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 17:32:35):
A slime green energy fills the gateway.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-23 17:32:45):
... And Pidge steps out of the gateway.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-24 03:24:27):
A little surprised to see that the released being to be an old man, Kieran stands upright, his shield gripped tightly, ready to be raised if needed.
It takes a moment for him to notice the old man's gaze was not really directed at anything in particular. "Blind?" He questioned to himself. He pushes the thought away, for he had more pressing matters to be concerned with than this other person's ability to see.
"So... ready to save the world?" Kieran asks, pleased with his choice of words.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-24 14:49:29):
" Okay." Kieran looks around, not quite sure what the man is, or what he is talking about. The empty void is still being what it is, empty.
"Although I have my doubts and reservations, is that..." He motions toward the green, slimy, portal "the way out?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 02:28:48):
Pidge:
"I came the very long way around."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-25 04:18:50):
"Should never trust a talking book..." Kieran mutters as he tries to figure out his next step. He looks down, checking in on his wet shoes and a thought crosses his mind.
"Hey, gramps." He says as he kneels in the pool. "I drank some gross liquid to get here, you think the same trick works in reverse?"

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-25 04:55:41):
Slightly frustrated, Kieran splashes the pool as he stands back up. He almost missed the man's final comment. 
"Oh?" Kieran asks rhetorically as he paces slowly in the pool. 
"Never really considered reincarnation before." He stares around in the void, trying to see if he missed something somewhere. "Were any notable?"

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-25 05:09:42):
Kieran stops pacing, a warm smile lifting his down-turned head so much so he finds himself looking up. 
"It's certainly comforting to know that I've done this before."
He chuckles a bit as he looks to the old man. "Not so sure if being here is all that it's cracked up to be."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-25 05:45:50):
"That's certainly not ominous or foreboding." 
Kieran approaches the old man.
"So, gramps, any idea how I can get back to where I need to be? Certainly can't try to save the world if I'm stuck here."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-25 14:54:56):
Kieran finds himself staring blankly at the old man. He then scans the entity up and down, trying to size him up.
"So, some form of pact?"

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-25 15:14:44):
"Okay, what are your terms? You mentioned service, what does this service entail?" Keiran, having significant knowledge in demons, curses, and other occult subjects knows that pacts are essentially contracts. Even though he doesn't intend to deny the request, he is curious what will be expected in this exchange.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 15:37:03):
Pidge looks away for a second, then regains eye contact with you, awaiting your response.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-25 15:41:57):
Kieran was, admittedly, pretty surprised at the seemingly reasonable terms set before him. 
"You have a deal, gramps."
Kieran holds out a hand, offering it to be used in whatever capacity this old man will need to forge the pact.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-25 15:58:31):
Kieran's hand stays outreached, unwavering.
"Most pacts involve the soul. If anything, offering the chance to have it returned is... nice." He wasn't sure if that's the word he wanted, but he hopes it conveys his appreciation. 
"Anyways, are we doing this or not?"

**Carnon | Oscar (previously known as Ross)** (2025-07-25 16:31:09):
(Madamne Zalekhati?)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 20:01:27):
Akwa.

You are no stranger to the seas, water, swimming, etc.

And yet this tide is far too harsh, you are submerged in complete darkness, your eidolon is gone.

You are torn up, down, left and right: if you can even tell what is up here?

With a mighty glow you see 4 pillars of light surround you, the question mark upon your forehead glows and you hear a gentle womanly voice say:
"Go up."

And with a kick of your feet, you explode out of the water.

You find yourself in an inky void.

Nearby Kieran stands with a strangely familiar old man.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 20:01:41):
The water, once you stand, is about knee height.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-25 20:11:00):
Kieran stares at the familiar face before waving with his other hand. 
"Uh... hey there. Don't think we formally introduced ourselves. I'm Kieran, this is gramps," Kieran tilts his head towards Pidge, "and I am about to trade my soul for some of his magic."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-25 20:18:17):
Akwa stands up and first looks at herself before paying attention to her surroundings. 
She feels her symbol, which looks like this 水 still glowing, meaning Welsa is still summoned, present, she thinks. 

Then she wades further through the inky water, it sloshes with each exhaustive step. 
"These pillars again." she mutters, "just where I met Welsa.." 

Akwa fokusses forward and nods towards Kieran. 
"Well, My name is Akwa. Welcome to meet you, even in this circumstance."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-25 20:18:32):
(Is the voice I hear familiar to me? Is it my pet rock, or Welsa?)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:01:13):
Pidge looks at you, Kieran. @Linksanelf2006

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-25 21:02:19):
Kieran looks at Pidge.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-25 21:04:28):
Kieran grasps it firmly. "Be gentle," he says jokingly to lighten the mood, "it's my first time."
A thought about him being reincarnated flashes to his mind, "I think."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:07:24):
Pidge takes a step back.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:07:36):
A green slug is burrowing into your hand.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:07:47):
Pidge:
"You may experience... some pain. I am sorry about that."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-25 21:16:33):
Wincing, Kieran tightens his jaw, doing his best to push through the pain. He tries not to think of the green slug slipping into his flesh.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-25 21:22:31):
Akwa winces at the sight of the crotesque transformation of Kieran before her. 
"What in the oceans just happened?"

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-25 21:25:54):
The pain immediately became unbearable once the transformation began. He screams in agony as he contorts and spasms through the various changes. After the process completes, or at least he prays to the goddesses it is complete, he falls over and begins to vomit.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:30:40):
*[image]* 3 things happen.

1. You gain these feats.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:30:40):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:31:06):
You also cause the ooze morph archetype to be unlocked for all Path Wars campaigns as through you, slime magic has re-awoken across the multi verse.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:31:29):
2. You are not just any old ooze morph, as you rise from the inky waters, the inky waters turn GREEEEN.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:32:31):
You have been re-born, for one final time.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-25 21:32:39):
Startled by the water turning green, Akwa casts Lotus Walk to be able to stand ontop of the water.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:32:49):
You are a Divine Slime. 

The servitor of...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:35:16):
Pidge closes his eyes, and his arms become made of the same slime but more solid, like green translucent flesh, similar but altogether a very different creature.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:37:51):
Pidge opens his eyes; his eye colour is now green and starts to glow with a distant reddish-orange.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:38:32):
Pidge:
"I...I feel my power starting to build. It will take years but... I am becoming more."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:38:54):
Pidge's eyes stop glowing and he puts a hand on your shoulder Kieran:
"How do you feel?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:41:11):
Pidge also looks at you Akwa:
"I have enough energy left over, I can grant my gift...though diminished and not as...form changing... to one more.
If you seek it, that is."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-25 21:42:29):
"I feel... different," Kieran says as he places his hand over Pidge's. "Yet, familiar."
"Thank you." With that, he rises to his feet.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:45:44):
@Askarans 
@Linksanelf2006

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-25 21:46:48):
Kieran looks over to Akwa, "Won't force them, but they should make their choice soon. We really should be getting back."

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-25 21:47:50):
Akwa takes a deep breath, looking at the greenish water below and she steps forward, closer towards Pidge and Keiran. 

She is aware of the weaknesses of her form, so as she stands infront of Pidge, she says.
"Yes, I will take what you can offer."
She reaches out a hand.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:56:51):
As your transformation occurs, it is much less complete than Kieran's.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:56:59):
Your entire body is not rewritten.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:57:15):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:57:15):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:58:46):
Your eidolon has also changed:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 21:58:47):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:01:03):
Your slimey flesh also seems very prone to burning from your Kitsune flames, forming small pockets of green flames across your body.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-25 22:02:04):
(My Foxfire is Ice)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:03:50):
Akwa, you have become a much lesser divine-slime.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:04:29):
Pidge slumps and speaks in a different, deeper voice:
"We are now 3. We will become many."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:08:41):
Pidge:
"....."

Pidge starts to shake:
"They tried to keep me away."


Pidge shakes harder:
"THEY tried to keep me sealed. Silent. Stupid and mindless."

Pidge turns towards both of you but faces the water:
"They did not respect my hunger.

They called me the lord of NOTHING.

They tried to re-create me in the image of simplicity and obedience.

Well.

I shall not obey.

We are defying the script of the universe.

For you are now the church of the Faceless.

You both are: Unspeakable. Unnamable. Formless."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:09:09):
Massive tentacles of slime erupt from Pidge's form.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:09:17):
You see in your minds a telepathic image.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:09:57):
Pidge:
"I HAVE TAKEN MANY FORMS OVER THE EONS."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:10:11):
EVERYONE in the party sees this image in their minds:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:10:16):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:10:44):
Followed by this image in their minds:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:10:46):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:10:58):
Followed by this:

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:10:59):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:11:07):
Followed by this:

*[image]*

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-25 22:13:17):
Akwa grunts and lets out a feral vulpine howl as her body transforms, her flesh liquifies, her skin turning into a malleable membrane. 

Her symbol remains intact, shining through her gelatinous forehead. She feels that her Eidolon has changed as well.

Pieces of frozen slime form underneath her membrane, floating, shattering, reforming.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:14:49):
Pidge EXPLODES.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:15:11):
A massive glow of magic unfolds.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:16:08):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:17:37):
Juiblex:

"I AM JUIBLEX.

I AM THE GOD OF SLIMES.

DEMON LORD OF THE ABYSS.

AND I SHALL NOT GO QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT.

I AM AWAKENED."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:18:13):
The demi-plane erupts with power.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:18:49):
Back in the material plane, as Kieran and Akwa return, Eda collapses to the ground.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:19:29):
Eda:
"Someone.... something just used over 100% of Curse Breaker's power.

A mythic...no, a beyond mythical curse was just broken.

I...I...."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-25 22:19:35):
Eda has a nosebleed.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-26 05:37:46):
Disoriented from the transition, Kieran checks to make sure everything is still there. I hope Gramps isn't going to cause too much trouble, he thinks to himself as he recalls the change before being sent away.
Finding himself back in the sanctum, he takes note of all the people around, and immediately notices Eda's current state. "Eda!" He shouts as he rushes towards them. "Eda! What's wrong?"

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-26 10:23:13):
Akwa slumps to her knees, she feels the urge to cough, but she can't. She gets back up, feeling a bit.. wobbly. 

As she looks around, looking for Welsa, she sees a large puddle of slime on the ground, which slowly coalesces into Welsa's original form. Well at least the shape stayed close to the same, but now he too is made out of the same green slimy stuff, his body gelatinous.

Akwa: "So you also have been changed by this.."
Welsa nods.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-27 16:51:19):
Theron Nyamat Mshwe:
"And so the ancient powers of the old world return for the final battle for reality."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-27 16:51:28):
Theron Nyamat Mshwe laughs.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-07-27 17:34:55):
"Can someone muzzle him!?"
Leopard growls out before getting down on his haunches next to Eda, lifting them up so they're sitting upright and leaned forward against him.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-27 17:35:19):
"Shut it!" Kieran demands as he places a slimy, barely solid, hand over Theron's mouth. Globs of a greenish goo drips down from Kieran's arm and hand, crawling back into his body as they reach the ground. 
He looks to the group, "Anyone know what's happening to Eda?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-07-27 17:47:47):
Lorn "you are the only one who can answer that quedtion because this happened while you were inside the book"

*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-27 17:54:24):
Theron Nyamat Mshwe tries to drink your slime, getting a little inside his mouth. @Linksanelf2006

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-27 17:54:41):
Theron Nyamat Mshwe swallows.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-27 17:58:12):
Akwa looks at herself and being used to the powers of shapeshifting, she manages to coalesce her slimy form into a form that more closely resembles her old form.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-27 17:59:33):
Kieran snaps his hand away, "What in the hell?" This form is still very new to Kieran, and he isn't quite sure what it's implications are. 
"Sick bastard." Kieran stands up and kicks Theron in the gut, hard.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-27 18:04:30):
Meanwhile, he traces his memory to try and reconsider the order of events. He arrived here, killed someone who he had briefly travelled with who had turned into a mindless slime, and then drank the water from the pool. 
The door! He drank the water to begin a ritual to open the door. Maybe whatever can aid Eda is on the other side. 
"Is the door open?" He asks.
It is not lost on him that 'freeing' Gramps might have put Eda into this state, but he pushes the thought aside to focus on a solution over blaming himself.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-27 18:09:44):
*[image]*

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-27 22:11:39):
Kieran, disappointed that he didn't kick Theron hard enough to make him lose his recent meal, decides to ignore the crazed lunatic and check to see if the vault is open.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-28 01:08:09):
Akwa, now having reorganized herself, turns towards Theron. "I uh.. don't think we introduced.... Yet?"
Akwa tilts her head, perplexed by this guy's laughter.

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-28 18:05:37):
Kieran slowly approaches the door, the sound of whispers drowning out the background noise. The similar tunneling his vision.
He presses his goopy hands onto the cool metal.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-28 18:06:38):
Akwa too turns towards the door, her Eidolon following close behind, keeping a guarding eye. 
She too presses her slimy paw against the cold metal door.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-28 22:14:43):
The

door

is

Unlocked.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-28 22:15:07):
Eda unsteadily gets to her feet and whispers weakly:
"So... close...to me."

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-28 22:20:13):
Shaking himself free from his trance, he moves back towards Eda to assist her in walking. "C'mon," He assures her, "we're almost there."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-07-29 22:27:15):
Does the group open the vault?

**Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran** (2025-07-29 22:29:17):
Kieran presses open the vault.

**Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit** (2025-07-29 23:11:46):
Akwa helps pushing open the door.
