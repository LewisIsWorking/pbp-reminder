**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2024-06-05 01:05:47):
As Tarsus makes his way into the ancient city with the others, he notices a dwarf hurriedly making his exit and calls out.
"Hey, dwarf! Hold up a sec. You with the first wave of adventurers they sent from Kibwe?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-06-05 06:51:42):
Padraig takes out a small leather pouch, quickly shakes from the pouch a small dash of a brown-grey powder onto the tip of a measuring spoon, less than 3 seconds later the dwarf sniffs the powder from the spoon, leaving none remaining.
Pádraig lets out a surprisingly soft grunt.

Padraig's eyes focus intensely on you now.
He speaks in a quick, hushed tone:
"Right.
Alchemy.
What do you need?
I'm at your disposal.

If you don't need anything I'll give your gear a quick once over and I'll be off."

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2024-06-05 15:27:17):
Tarsus is slightly confused at the sudden shift in demeanor.
"A spare healing elixir if you've got any. And if you could direct us to whatever point of interest the rest of your team was investigating, that would be helpful."
He reaches into his pack for something to write on, then turns back to his two traveling companions.
"Fierce Leopard, Tiny, you need anything?

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2024-06-05 22:52:19):
Tiny skulks up to him, "Look valuable, give me one too"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-06-06 00:02:36):
Pádraig leaves Tarsus and Tiny standing in the entrance ramp together, while he leaves the building, to stand by the carriage.

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2024-06-06 02:40:51):
Tiny greedily grabs the elixir and runs down the path

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-06-07 02:18:41):
"We should catch up with Tiny before they get themselves into trouble." Fierce Leopard adjusts his pack on his back and makes sure his grip is sure on his trusty shield before making to follow the goblin.

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2024-06-07 02:29:22):
"...right. At least he's going roughly in the right direction."
He turns to the dwarf. "Thanks for the potions. We should catch up to your friends soon."
Tarsus picks up his backpack and goes after the others, following the dwarf's directions towards the structure where the other adventurers should be.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-06-10 16:33:50):
You both catch up to the group.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2024-06-10 16:35:20):
You find yourself surrounded by ghouls hanging by nooses wrapped around thick concrete beams.

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2024-06-10 16:51:26):
"we've been sent to help, you guys have been taking too long" Tiny pokes one of the ghouls with his giant spear to see if it moves "what did these ghouls do to piss you off?"

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2024-06-10 17:04:37):
Tarsus will investigate the runes with detect magic and read aura.
"The same runes are on the bodies and the walls? Is it part of a language or something symbolic?"

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2024-06-10 17:31:20):
/roll 1d20+11

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2024-06-11 19:54:52):
While the others are focused on the runes and writing Fierce Leopard will look carefully around the rest of the room and will do a seek check to see if there are any secrets hidden within the room that may have been missed.
