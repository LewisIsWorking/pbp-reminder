The sweatshop.

You are in this long strangely designed room.

The room's shape seems to almost contradict itself as it bends and weaves in width and height along the length of the room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-01 20:22:15):
There are 3 doors.

One to the west.

One to the south.

and BIG DOORS to the East.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-01 20:22:32):
There are many tools and supplies in the sweatshop.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-01 20:23:07):
Crates of cloth, lumber, nails, dried reeds, leather and many tools such as hammers, pliers, files, etc.

What are your character's alignments? 
Feel free to message me privately if you wish.

I cannot fully describe the room until I know this.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-01 20:24:49):
Also, what is everyone's passive perception?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-01 20:27:16):
Also, there is a small treasure chest in the corner that looks to be where you would store more precious materials..

Assuming someone opens it the group finds:
- A fine spyglass.
- A runestone with +1 potency rune.
- A runestone with a resiliency rune.
- And some strange blood-soaked bags.

But you ultimately can resist the temptation.

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2025-02-17 23:50:53):
Tiny grabs the book "I know how to read, it might have a clue"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-18 06:36:54):
What happens next? :)

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2025-02-18 18:10:20):
"ohh this is one of the books that speaks directly to the head, that sure beats reading" Tiny shoves the book into his wasteband

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-02-18 22:52:04):
"...yeah, if the book is talking to you that's probably not a good sign considering what these cultists were preparing as an offering."

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2025-02-18 23:21:34):
"my book,  you guys can split the other loot" Tiny snarls "Don't be scared of it, I think it's just a self help book to improve self-esteem"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-22 22:23:19):
What happens next? :)

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-02-22 22:36:32):
Leopard pokes at one of the blood soaked bags in the chest with a piece of stray metal. "I know this will sound weird coming from me, but why would anyone want to keep some blood soaked bags? Especially with some other fancy crap."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-26 03:40:53):
When you poke the blood soaked bags you hear the faint clinking sound of metal touching metal and a plopping sound of flesh popping.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-02-26 03:41:07):
What happens next? :)

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-02-26 03:54:43):
"Well, maybe not heads. Would have heard bones crunching in that case. But definitely something fleshy." Using the piece of metal he prods at the opening of the sack to see if he can't see what once was inside before he triggered the trap or failsafe that was inside it.
