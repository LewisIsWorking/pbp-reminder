Towering above, the remnants of this ancient Xaatran architecture that you find yourself within casts long, skeletal shadows across the city. 

A stifling silence hangs heavy in the air of this expansive, sun deprived courtyard within the crumbling ruins of Holy Xatramba.

To the west, a pair of imposing wooden double doors stand sentinel.

Each panel is emblazoned with a massive, chilling carving: a six-fingered hand with impossibly long, razor-sharp talons, a grim testament to the forgotten powers that once held sway in this forgotten city.

Flanking the doors, mosaic murals crawl across the sunbaked walls.

They depict a horrifying tableau: 
a monstrous humanoid figure, a grotesque fusion of saurian and simian features, adorned with wickedly curved horns and those same six-fingered, clawed hands. 
This monstrous entity gorges on a scene of carnage, devouring a menagerie of unfortunate creatures in a display of primal savagery.

As your gaze travels down the murals, a sense of unease grows.
The lower portions seem to depict even greater threats, shadowy tendrils writhing ominously beneath the clawed figure, hinting at unseen horrors that lurk beyond the veil.
