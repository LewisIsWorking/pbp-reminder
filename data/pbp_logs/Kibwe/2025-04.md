**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-01 12:47:15):
Theron also looks to the wider group:
"Friends, friends, please speak up.

I wish to meet you all.

I will tell you what you'd like to know.

My knowledge is yours my friends."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-01 13:53:05):
@Nemesiux 

Ademe telepathically says to Lorn:

"The painting, I have been thinking upon it.

After this is all dealt with, I will help you to activate the painting and see what is does.

As I said before, your soul is in touch with Pharasma."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-04-01 14:36:25):
Leopard barely contains his rage and through gritted teeth he starts to speak.

"Then tell me this. What threat? What fucking threat? Because all I see is you being a threat to the people of Kibwe and beyond. What damned threat is worth all this? All this pain, suffering, torture, MURDER! Destroying families, destroying communities. People's lives aren't just TOOLS! And here you are just laughing and acting like we know nothing. Then tell me, WHY are you doing THIS?"

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2025-04-01 18:34:55):
Tiny looks confused "is this the guy were supposed to kill?"

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-04-01 19:17:42):
"Yeah, I think so, Tiny. It's not as if there are some magic words that are going to convince him to have a change of heart at this point. Whatever effects, intended or not, this priest's actions have caused, he thinks it's the right thing to do. Whatever the reasons, we all disagree. Not much to discuss."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-01 19:26:25):
"I am judging him, and I sentence him to Oblivion for his actions"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-02 19:55:16):
Theron continues:
"And even if what i was doing was a complete act of war, a complete act of anarchy and destruction it is not for two reasons.

One: my god approves, giving me the visions to lead me onto this most holy of quests.

Two: I did not want the Paradise corporation to run their experiment......

Do you know what your Ademe was planning to do?"

Theron ends his statement looking from Leopard to Lorn questioningly.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-02 20:15:25):
Also, you notice Theron has a drum that looks to be made of skin and bone with runic carvings that match his necklace.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-05 22:46:58):
Theron:
"And, of course, the people here in this complex.

I, too, soon shall be slime."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-05 22:47:52):
Theron:
"They would have DIED.

Or became monsters far beyond what they were, with no semblance of their morality left.

I have SAVED them."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-05 22:49:37):
@MrNegetZ 

Theron:
"And dog man, your arm, a very special blessing that is."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-05 22:50:48):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-06 00:00:01):
Theron continues:
"If you bring curse breaker and her small army of hired guards and monsters kill you all, then she can absolutely reverse the curse alterations."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-06 00:20:12):
Theron:
"Paga Nikohian is a halfling supremacist, she has very racially charged views.

Unlike myself, who allows all races into my faith."

Theron indicates to the demon dinosaur.

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-04-06 01:18:44):
"Um, actually, humans are dire halflings. I thought that was common knowledge."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-06 13:06:41):
Theron will also look at Eda and say:
"Curse breaker.
I am sorry for taking you from your home.
Maybe one day you can return."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-06 13:06:51):
Eda looks uncomfortable and does not answer.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-04-07 10:10:00):
"How about an outcome where we don't die a slime and don't become blood monsters either? Ever thought of that?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-07 10:19:40):
"But of course it could be altered to affect only corpses and to hunt the demon invaders of this land. I must say Theron you are truely briliant. Father has been searching for ways to direct mindless undead for a long time."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-07 11:19:29):
"Theron the dead remember unlike the living."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-07 11:21:22):
Lorn remains silent for a second then sents Aderme a message "You are rather quiet. This mortal keeps saying stuff about you which may be true and yet you are not defending youself."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-07 12:10:08):
"My curse would have affected only the willing dead or soulless corpses to wipe out the demon invaders so that we don't get Sarkoris 2.0, but have it your way Daichi waste your time on arguing with me instead of saving your wife"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-07 12:11:18):
"You are blinded by rage"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-07 12:17:26):
"If my father was here he would have killed this man before he could have said a word, yet here you are considering me an enemy when I helped you so far"

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2025-04-07 13:08:57):
Tiny is watching and getting impatient. "We don't have a lot of time and this fool has wasted enough of it, it doesn't matter what he says because I don't trust him, if he doesn't want to fight us it will make killing him easier."

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-08 13:37:37):
Lorn looks around "Where is this cursebreaker?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-08 14:35:26):
"While at it you could tell me who this green flame fella is
He seems awfully similar to my father in terms of powers, although he seems to specialize in something else"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-08 14:49:52):
Lorn also draws his bow

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-08 15:30:46):
"His right for self-defense was gone the moment he infected everyone against their will. Us fighting him would be self-defense or rather a fight for our survival"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-08 19:47:41):
Eda tells you Lorn:
"Some sort of complex rune was written on the vault.

You need to use your knowledge of magic to read it."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-08 19:48:01):
Theron smirks and does nothing to stop Lorn leaving.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-08 20:05:51):

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-08 20:05:58):
Lorn's religion check

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-09 09:52:39):
Did you reroll?

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-09 10:01:04):
No it said server offline

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-09 10:01:11):
I will try to do it today

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-09 10:25:56):
I'll launch the server now.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-09 11:03:23):
*[image]* L

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-09 11:03:35):
Lorn looks at Eda "Can you do it?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-09 17:35:01):
Lorn leaves the shrine and also asks Daichi "Can you do it?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-09 17:36:27):
"The seal seems to be powered by an outside sourse
It might explain why Theron said if we would arrest him alive
He is the same as his kid, he is powering the seal or something similar to that"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-09 17:40:09):
"If he just wants to stand there let him
He is too blinded by his pride
I grow bored of these mortal games
Let's finish this"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-10 18:22:21):
For some reason this did not show as a nat 1 (red text)

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-10 18:23:37):
an even bigger L

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-10 23:32:50):
And someone roll for Eda.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-10 23:32:51):

with 2 hero points

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-13 20:26:36):
I will assume the group had reunited in the courtyard where Theron sits happily next to the pond with his two female companions.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-13 23:59:41):
Theron looks like he has no intention to open the vault.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-14 00:03:22):
What happens next?

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-14 00:13:17):
"There is only one way to find out"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-04-14 05:23:19):
Lorn fires an arrow meant for one of the women

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-14 10:30:14):
Theron sighs as he prepares to fight:
"Very well my friends.
Let us dance with death."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 21:34:20):
Theron wins initiative with a 29.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-04-18 21:34:32):
