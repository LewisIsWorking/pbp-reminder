**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 14:10:02):
What happens next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-02 14:31:28):
Would you like to dig around in each of the meat-balls?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-03 09:24:50):
What happens next? :)

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-03 15:17:07):
It wouldn't be too unreasonable to find tongs and heavy duty gloves made for handling blazingly hot metal considering we're in a forge area, right?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-03 15:18:05):
Very doable

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-03 15:19:43):
Then Leopard would grab some gloves, put them on, grab a pair of tongs and start careful checking these things out. Not expecting anything valuable, but maybe some knowledge regarding what they're up to in here would be useful.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-03 15:24:21):
Inside each of the meatballs are various keys.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-03 15:24:40):
When you finish breaking up each collection of mashed up flesh

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-03 15:24:46):
You have a bunch of keys and a key ring.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-03 15:25:05):
You now have a keyring of many keys of various kinds of keys.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-03 15:25:13):
What happens next? :)

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-03 16:13:41):
Cleaning the keys and keyring up as best as he can given the condition they were in, Leopard inspects the keys  before shaking them to draw the attention of the others. "So, do you think there are really this many rooms and doors in here or do we got something else on our hands?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-04 17:10:31):
What happens next? :)

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2025-03-05 15:26:28):
"no sense thinking about it" Tiny checks which of the doors in this room are locked

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-08 20:57:03):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-08 20:57:15):
The western door is locked, there is a key matching the door on your ring of keys.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-08 20:58:27):
*[image]* These Eastern doors ARE locked as well BUT they do not seem to have traditional locks, they seem sealed by a combination of magic and mechanical forces.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-08 20:59:56):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-08 21:00:11):
This southern door is also new, and locked BUT the door locks match the ring of keys!

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-08 21:00:14):
SO.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-08 21:00:20):
East.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-08 21:00:21):
South.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-08 21:00:23):
West.

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-03-08 23:33:43):
Tarsus will investigate the enchantment on the eastern door. Mainly trying to determine if there's any defensive enchantment or if the magic is just sealing the door. (foundry is on the other table rn)

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-03-09 02:19:48):
Tarsus will search for the control mechanism then.

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-03-09 02:28:10):
"I'm curious about the older door but the control mechanism must be on the other side. May as well go where the keys will take us and see what we can find."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-09 02:34:40):
"Are we ready to move on or do we wanna make sure we've not missed anything in here first?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 04:20:04):
*Did this on VC*

Daichi goes back to the Forge and finds the secret passage to the Warehouse room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 04:21:06):
Daichi unlocks and explores the WESTERN DOOR.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 04:24:08):
This square room has many things linings its walls: 
- A collection of artwork of Angazhan, these are artworks are crude and like cave painting but on canvas.
- A small COVERED painting. There is a black tarp over the painting.
- Some ancient Azlanti artwork are of pieces of technology, sunny beaches and portraits of chalices of various blood types.
- An Azlanti painting of Pharasma as a grim reaper.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 04:24:18):
Additionally there is a door to the West.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 04:24:59):
Upon opening this door you see it leads to several tunnels going out of the facility and into other buildings in the unholy city.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 04:27:39):
With the group's knowledge of the city's layout this will likely take you to one of the strongholds of Angazhan in the city.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 04:28:04):
IF you were to go down one of these tunnels you would be breaking into a hive of cultists numbering the hundreds if not thousands.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 04:28:19):
A guaranteed death sentence.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-09 04:28:43):
Daichi will search that room for a secret passage?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 04:29:15):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 04:29:31):
However are you searching the room generally?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 04:30:32):
Of the search check.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 04:34:20):
It was hidden behind several paintings.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 04:34:22):
Also

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 04:34:32):
Is anyone in the group a Pharasmian?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-09 04:43:14):
Daichi checks  the lever for traps even though it shouldn't have much since it was hidden...

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-09 04:45:05):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 04:46:23):
What happens next? :)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-09 04:46:33):
Pull the level since no traps... hope i don't regret it...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 04:47:33):
Next? :)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-09 04:47:55):
"Hmm so there was a lever in this room and there's probably a lever in the other room to the south as well... Once we pull both the door opens... Simplistic but i didn't expect much more from these cultists anyways."

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-09 04:48:57):
Daichi and Party will move to the southern door.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 05:01:41):
You are in the prison.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 05:02:00):
There are dozens and dozens of prisoners chained along the EASTERN and WESTERN walls.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 05:02:49):
They are all extremely: dirty, sweaty, smelly, bloodied, sick, starving, dehydrated and sleepy.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 05:02:56):
They barely move as you enter the room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 05:02:58):
Some are dead.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 05:03:23):
Their maggot-festering corpses are still chained to the walls.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 05:03:38):
IT looks like some of the prisoners have ate some of the maggots... and their friends.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 05:03:43):
All out of desperation.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 05:04:08):
Many look to have been tortured with eye lids, eyes, fingers, feet and more all missing amongst the prisoners.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 05:04:31):
Two members of the prisoners are not badly off as the others, clearly adventurers themselves.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 05:05:02):
A rat woman  and a big orc man.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 05:05:22):
The centre of the room is a torture / meat preparation station / sacrificing altar.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 05:05:41):
There are bags of some kind of dried leaves on the table.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 05:06:07):
The smell of shit, vomit and blood is over powering and causes your eyes to water.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 05:09:44):
The SOUTHERN door seems to have magical runes carved in by the cultists, demon runes.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 05:09:48):
@MrNegetZ Next?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 05:10:14):
The ratwoman and orc are whispering to themselves, seeing what will happen next.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 05:10:26):
The other prisoners are quiet or sleeping a hazy sleep.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-09 05:15:26):
"Ok everyone! First off, good new! You're going to be free from your unjust imprisonment as we are here under the orders of the Kibwe city council and are currently raiding the place. We got people outside that will hopefully take care of you all. Before we start though. Does anyone know how to open this door?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 05:18:53):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 05:19:31):
Across the room to you Daichi.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 05:23:30):
@MrNegetZ

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-03-09 05:37:14):
Tarsus will brave the stench and see if he recognizes the dried leaves. (assuming that's a no with nature roll of 11)

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-03-09 05:42:55):
"Can't smell anything other than the prisoners. Eurgh. Lorn, shall we take a look at those runes?"
He moves on to the runes, he will try to determine their purpose. Will Aid if Lorn wants to work together.

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-03-09 05:48:24):
"Fair enough." Tarsus will Prestidigitate any prisoners that aren't dead to help with the smell.

**Justin Sherfield** (2025-03-09 05:53:00):
A rhythmic clack of boots fractures the hush that settles over the scene. From the northern gloom, a figure emerges—a specter of dominance, quiet calculation in every measured motion.

The flickering light barely grazes his face. Sharp features, assessing eyes. A mask of control, though something wilder lingers beneath, untamed and restless.

The dark-skinned man tilts his head. An ear-to-ear smile forms, slow and knowing, as his gaze locks onto Eda. The air thickens. Unspoken intent hums between them, his eyes tracing her figure.

"Striking," he murmurs, a commanding Mwangian accent laced with amusement. "One does not often find such beauty standing unguarded." 

He steps closer, deliberate in his pace. Space narrows, time stretches. He lets the moment breathe.

"And yet," he continues, voice smooth, "the more intriguing mystery is why you are all here. Alone?"

His lingering gaze breaks, shifting between each party member, "Iwao Aldori."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 16:49:30):
So what happens next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 22:29:38):
The rat woman says:
"I am Dhira Graycheeks and this is my edge lord best friend Tavik.
We, well, I am a scholar."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-09 22:30:03):
Dhira Graycheeks continues:
"And you lot don't look much like demon crazy cultists!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-10 00:10:50):
Dhira Graycheeks looks to the group for a response.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-10 00:22:40):
"Of course ma'am" Leopard grabs the keyring back and moves towards the woman. "Let me just get a look at these and see if any of these keys work. If not I'll just have to break them off ya."

**Isaac error1 | #6 Tiny** (2025-03-10 00:29:13):
"It's best if you leaving this kind of thing to the profisionals, this is no places for scholars. If you're lost we can give you directions to the exit."

**Justin Sherfield** (2025-03-10 02:23:22):
Iwao’s approach is unhurried, his gait fluid, confident—like the danger was an afterthought. His hand rests on the flyssa’s pommel, a statement rather than a threat. At least, not yet.

"Kibwe’s salvation?" His fingers drum idly against the hilt of his weapon, but his stance stays relaxed. "A noble cause. A dangerous one. The sort of pursuit that draws both the righteous and ruthless!" 

His weary eyes settle to his tremoring hand—thin fractures revealing premature crow's feet. "I wish to live another day... lest it be taken by the blade!" 

The enthusiastic smile he wears glints unnaturally in the dim light. Fine metal inlaid in his teeth catches the ambient glow. Gaudy? Absolutely.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 02:23:56):
@MrNegetZ 

Do you unlock all of the prisoners in the room?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-11 02:24:02):
Also I believe @RyoYamakawa has all of the keys?

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-11 05:53:41):
Leopard frowns at his companion's suggestion. "A cultist, we shall consider it. But those of the prisoners who do survive should be given every chance to escape. We would be no better than those disgusting and dangerous ones if we considered harming these people in such a way."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-11 23:20:28):
"Now, can someone pass me a healer's kit? I don't got one and I doubt any of these people want me to feed them my blood after all the crap they've been through." He says this as he starts pulling out his rations to divide up and share amongst the freed prisoners.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-12 00:47:25):
"Do you really want to chance attention being drawn just yet by going that far to fetch it before we're ready to get these people out?" Leopard takes the healer's toolkit and starts looking over the former prisoners, getting an idea of what he needs to do before starting his work.

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-03-12 01:40:17):
Tarsus starts power washing a corner of the room with spout and prestidigitate.

**Justin Sherfield** (2025-03-13 03:52:45):
Iwao moves with the grace of a man who understands the weight of every gesture, every word. As he kneels before the prisoners, his hands remain methodical, helping distribute dried rations. Where he lacked altruism, he imitates the efforts of these heroes.

“Take this,” he murmurs, pressing a strip of dried meat into the frail hands of a prisoner barely strong enough to hold it. He lingers—just a second longer than necessary. The golden glint of his teeth dims into something softer, more solemn. “You have endured more than most. That means something.”

He searches for the ones whose breath comes shallow, whose grip falters. The ones whose eyes no longer burn with defiance, but with resignation. 

“There comes a time,” he speaks clear, his voice carrying through the cavernous space, “when a man understands that his fight is not for himself alone." Like a predator on the prowl, he approaches a less fortunate prisoner at random, whispering, “And even now, you have a choice.” A pause—intentional, heavy, “The weak fade but the strong choose. Will you make that choice for our future?”

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-13 04:08:45):
*[image]* (Rerolled using 2 hero points so i think this is actually a 20 since it's a d10+10.)

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-13 06:03:38):
Leopard follows Daichi's lead, trending more towards the weak, but still mobile looking prisoners. While doing so he attempts to talk with them about what they have seen or heard during their time here. Anything that might prepare us for the further horrors we may see ahead.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-14 01:11:59):
They have witnessed friend, family and stranger sacrificed upon the table.

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-14 02:15:25):
Any particular ones the cultists deferred to or mentioned by name? Or who they were worshipping when they sacrificed the others?

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-14 04:48:00):
After making my rounds and thanking every one of them for talking with me, knowing it was hard for them to talk about, and promising that we would do everything we could to make sure they got out safely while giving them some part of my rations I would return what remains of the healer's toolkit back to Daichi. "Thank you for letting me use this. I really should've got my own, but I wasn't expecting to find so many people captured and in need of healing."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-16 04:30:38):
What happens next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 15:37:29):
The man with his bald head and dirty long gray beard.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-19 15:43:21):
The old man wheezes:
"My wife is asleep, she is weak, this ordeal will probably be..."

The old man nearly falls over from his coughing fit:
"...be the last ordeal of our lives.
I am ok with this.

I know what you want."

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-03-20 00:39:32):
Tarsus will sift through the contents on the table/altar to see if there are anything resembling instructions for the ritual to unlock the runed door. 
"I assume there's more to the puzzle than just a knife and a volunteer. These cultists seem to have a very particular way of doing things. Not that I'd expect them to leave an instruction manual lying around."

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-03-20 00:42:14):
*[image]*

**Buffet Raider |Tarsus Longstaff #6** (2025-03-20 02:02:44):
"Figures. Unless someone more knowledgeable about this demon lord they worship has any ideas, we may need to ask @errror01 Tiny's new book."

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-20 02:05:29):
While the rest of the group is fumbling with figuring out the sacrifice he was against doing, Leopard carefully sneaks back into the previous room to make sure it is still unoccupied and to start planning for how they are going to get all these people out of here.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-20 02:42:48):
This complex is fairly isolated in terms of the tunnels being very long to get into it, a bit of a maze/labyrinth

**Justin Sherfield** (2025-03-20 02:59:03):
*[image]* (To recall the ritual he was privy to seeing leading up to his debut)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-20 03:02:15):
Successfully.

**Justin Sherfield** (2025-03-20 03:17:01):
As Iwao guides the old man forward, his mind drifts—memories flashing in segments.

He remembers the flickering firelight. The guttural chants rising in crescendo. The way he had donned the guise of a devoted brother among the cultists of Angazhan. He had matched their fervor, their revelry—drinking deep, praising the Ravenous King. 

And then, the shift. 

He had struck like a viper. A whisper of steel. A flurry of methodical, clean strikes. The firelight painted him in crimson as he moved. The Flyssa in his grasp carved through flesh and devotion alike.

They had never even seen it coming.

Now, here, in the dim glow of another makeshift ritual, the echoes of that night surge within him. His lips curl as sacred mutterings spill forth. An eerie, rhythmic chant spoken in a tongue meant only for those who know true power. His feet carry him in an primal, untamed dance. He hops, twists, pivots, his body demonstrating strength and power. 

His breath comes in sharp bursts as he leaps onto the altar’s summit, towering above the elder. His voice swells, the final words of the chant bursting forth as he pounds his chest with brutal force.

And with that, his fists, Angazhan's favored weapon, crash down.

Flesh gives way beneath the blow. A sickening thud not once but thrice. The old man crumples, his weakened frame offering no resistance. His skull cracks. His neck snaps.

**Justin Sherfield** (2025-03-20 03:17:43):
(I improvised the details. You want a performance check?)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-20 03:21:14):
Two thinks happen.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-20 03:21:19):
First.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-20 03:21:22):
The man dies.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-20 03:21:38):
His blood flows fast and free onto the runes on the ground.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-20 03:21:42):
The door is unlocked.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-20 03:21:45):
The party may proceed.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-20 03:21:47):
Two.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-20 03:21:50):
SCREAMING.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-20 03:21:57):
The freed prisoners are HORRIFIED.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-20 03:22:01):
They run and run and run.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-20 03:22:20):
Those who can't move are carried or dragged by the sudden brutal nature of this assault.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-20 03:22:31):
Some had an idea the group was considering it.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-20 03:22:45):
None thought it would happen, or at least not like this.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-20 03:23:00):
After about 30 seconds only two of the prisoners remain the in the room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-20 03:23:12):
The orc man and the rat scholar woman.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-20 03:23:19):
They seem unsure but not immediately hostile.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-20 03:23:50):
+1 Villain Point @jay94rn

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-20 03:24:47):
Hearing the screams Leopard dashes back towards the prison, his movement cut short as prisoners flee all around him. Fuck, what happened? He pushes his way through the panicked people to get back into the room and see what has happened. "What the hell? What's going on?!"

**Justin Sherfield** (2025-03-20 03:28:26):
Sliding down the side of the altar, his movements lose their calculated grace. No more flashing teeth—no triumph, no guile. His shoulders sag, his posture broken in a way he has never allowed before.

His hands come together, fingers interlocking tightly, as if clinging to something unseen. His head bows. The expression on his face—unreadable. Pained? Regretful?

A murmur escapes his lips, low, reverent. His words turn toward Sarenrae.

"Everlight, I have done what must be done."

His voice raises enough for onlookers to hear— theatrics?

**Justin Sherfield** (2025-03-20 03:28:39):
(You want a deception or are the NPCs still on edge)

**Justin Sherfield** (2025-03-20 03:39:05):
*[image]* (Lying about the guilt?)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-20 03:45:27):
Dhira Gray-Cheeks looks uncertain:
"I think.....I dunno... I suppose... it had to happen?"

**Ryo Yamakawa | #1 Rax | #6 Fierce Leopard Cyrus** (2025-03-20 03:50:52):
"You! You fucking dumbass!" Leopard marches over to the newcomer and a gutteral growl escapes him as he gets directly in his face. "Even if this fucking thing was actually necessary what possessed you to do it with all of those sick, injured, TRAUMATIZED!, people watching!?" He stabs at Iwao with a clawed finger. "Now all of them have ran off and are very much in more danger than they were before. We should have been helping them dammit, not making things even worse!" Leopard clenches his teeth and snorts before turning away and starting for the door out of the prison. "I'm going to try and salvage this fucking disaster, though I doubt I will be able to after this." He mutters under his breath as he walks away.

**Justin Sherfield** (2025-03-20 04:02:09):
He did not flinch when the clawed finger jabbed toward him, nor did he recoil from the heat of Leopard’s fury pressing against his face. Instead, he sighed. A deep, weary thing, as if carrying a weight far heavier than the situation at hand. When he finally lifted his gaze, his lips smacked in defiance.

"You think I do not regret it?" he murmured, lying through his teeth. He slowly, deliberately pushed himself to his feet, keeping his hands raised slightly, not in surrender, but in deference to the emotion crackling between them.  A beat of silence, and then, Iwao’s expression shifted—something faintly pleading in the way he looked at Leopard’s retreating form.

"We will save Kibwe, truly. They will live to see another day."

Edit: He proceeds opposite to the rabble, inspecting what lies beyond the door.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:13:20):
Iwao Aldori.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:13:29):
You go up to the rune carved wooden doors.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:13:33):
And push them open.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:15:26):
This is a BIG space.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:15:39):
There are two rooms.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:15:55):
With an open plan wall between them.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:17:05):
These rooms are different.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:17:30):
These rooms are cleaner and more maintained.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:17:49):
It's clear these two rooms are not nearly as travelled or used as much as the rest of the facility.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:18:00):
Most likely due to the steep entry requirement.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:18:30):
The 1st room has a plaque saying:
"Hand Gallery."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:18:51):
The 2nd room is a metal room with a wicked shrine spire.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:19:08):
The 2nd room has a plaque saying:
"Private shrine: do not enter."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:20:34):
There are 3 exits.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:21:50):
The hand gallery has a massive stone door with semi-glowing runes.

The exact same door as the one in the sweatshop work shop room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:22:45):
The private shrine has an Eastern door as well, this door is fully metal and looks magical-mechanical in nature.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:22:53):
Essentially a vault door.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:23:02):
EVERYONE in the group is DRAWN heavily to the vault door.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:23:38):
Eda "Curse Breaker" Stones-Worth says:
"I. I. I. I am behind that door.
I am in this vault.

WE ARE HERE MY FRIENDS.

You have found me."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:24:12):
The hand gallery has hundreds of hands.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:24:32):
Each hand has 6 fingers per hand, a clear sign of magical mutation caused by divine blessing.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:24:53):
Each pair of hands has a plaque, one of the plaques is particularly large and older.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-22 22:33:18):
Also, I may have forgotten to mention this but it is clear all of the prisoners who are human will be dead in a couple of days as they ALL carry the plague.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-24 01:55:02):
What happens next? :)

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-24 02:37:16):
Looking at all the chaos cause by 1 door. Daichi will shrug
"Well that went a bit differently than it should've... You went way too fast with the operation here Iwao or whatever your name is. We do have this door open but I'm just thinking. What about the other door. We pulled 1 level out of 2 but didn't see a second lever. Let's backtrack to the room with the tunnel. We might have missed something. Wouldn't want anything to come up behind us while we are getting the statue."

**Justin Sherfield** (2025-03-24 05:40:00):
I'll be busy so yall take the reigns, gl (sorry for causing panic with the prisoners 😂)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-25 02:19:17):

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-25 02:25:45):
@MrNegetZ 

Fortitude or Willpower saving throw.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-25 02:25:51):
Your choice.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-25 13:36:24):
The painting shakes.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-25 13:36:27):
Then turns to ash.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-25 13:38:31):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-25 13:38:47):
This doesn't seem like the Kibwe curse *exactly*.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-25 13:39:20):
Your arm is under your control and while it may be cursed (or a blessing?) it does not seem to inhibit your arm.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-25 13:40:11):
Dhira Gray-Cheeks is shocked:
"That blank painting, it....it...what happened, it's ash and your arm, your arm is, oh by the gods!"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-25 13:41:53):
Anyone can read the runes with a magic check.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-25 13:46:23):
This a lvl 8 + trap ;-;

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-25 16:06:40):
*[image]* And yes IT DOES count as a lore skill(so lower DC).

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-25 16:12:46):
Do I understand what it says at all?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-26 04:16:29):
If you had to estimate their potency and the complexity of the rune's designs.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-26 06:07:46):
So, what happens next? :)

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-27 08:26:01):
As described.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-27 08:26:17):
The room has hundreds of mummified hands.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-27 08:26:48):
One has a special display.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-27 08:26:54):
What would you all like to do next?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-27 08:28:06):
And to the south is a metallic room of dark metal.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-27 08:28:10):
With a large private shrine.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-27 08:28:24):
This is likely the primary shrine to the Gorilla Demon Lord.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-27 08:28:28):
Of the complex.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-27 08:29:47):
*[image]* Daichi searches the hand room.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-27 08:30:41):
Of various races found in this region.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-27 08:31:06):
The text below each indicates these to have been various leaders of the faith of the Gorilla God.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-27 08:33:10):
The display tells you that these are the hands of a Gorilla King.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-27 08:33:28):
These are the almost-heralds of Angazhan.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-27 08:33:41):
Divine servants, top 10 followers of Angazhan.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-27 08:33:54):
These paws once belonged to one of these Gorilla Kings.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-27 08:34:03):
There is only one Gorilla King at a time.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-27 08:35:21):
With the group's knowledge of religion you would know the current Gorilla King is one of Golarion's most powerful (highest level) Fighters: 

Ruthazek The Silverback King.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-27 08:35:42):
A famed figure in Forbidden Jungle and further out in Garund.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-27 08:36:42):
"Ok weird collection.. No lever here it seems.."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-27 08:41:21):
Dhira Gray-Cheeks looks excited and takes notes:
"What a find!"

**Eimer Hone** (2025-03-28 19:10:19):
It is the only thing in the room? Leilani might take a walk around to see if there is anything else

**Eimer Hone** (2025-03-29 19:27:03):
“Let’s move on everyone. Clearly nothing here.”

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-29 20:19:28):
Lorn shows her the Pharasma painting " Any ideas my priestess?"

@PathWars

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 03:36:32):
Ademe says:
"How goes your exploration deeper into the complex?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 03:42:58):
Ademe:
"That is strange, there are many strange magics in this place."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:18:26):
Anyone else?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:36:20):
AN ARCANE LOCK AS YOU TURN THE PAWNS OVER AFTER LIFTING THEM FROM THEIR DISPLAY SHELF CABINET.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:36:27):
RUNES OF ARCANE POWER

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:36:31):
LOCK SOMETHING

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:36:38):
ROLL

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:36:39):
ARCANA

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:36:40):
OR

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:36:43):
RELIGION

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:36:48):
TO UNLOCK THE PAWS

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:40:25):
And a 31 in arcana.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:40:37):
You decipher the arcane lock.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:40:46):
You weave a rune in the air.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:40:53):
And the paws unlock.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:40:55):
2 things.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:40:56):
1.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:41:20):
Inside of the paws is a small wooden storage box.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:42:15):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:42:30):
Also, the hands are magical items.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:42:42):
Wearing the gloves allows you to turn into a gorilla at will.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:42:58):
But you grow a 6th finger on your hands.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:43:05):
Do you open the box?

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:44:38):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:45:00):
YOU HAVE UNLOCKED SIX FINGERS ELIXIR.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:47:30):
There is nothing else in the room.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-30 09:48:07):
The 'shrine' to the south?

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-30 09:48:16):
Search:

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-30 09:50:01):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:52:33):
You step into the private shrine.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:52:46):
The black metal of this room cover the walls, the floor and the ceiling.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:55:36):
The shrine is a towering obelisk-like structure.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:56:04):
The shrine has much written scrawlings.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:56:22):
The moment you step into this room you start to feel illness.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:56:37):
Some of you will recognise this plight.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:56:47):
It is alignment sickness.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:57:23):
Spending too much time in this room will turn anyone chaotic evil.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:58:06):
As you look at your feet, you realise how much blood has dried into the metal, many many sacrifices have been held in this room over a very very long time.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:58:10):
This shrine is powerful.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:58:13):
This shrine is divine.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:59:09):
This is one of the most powerful shrines to Angazhan in perhaps the multi-verse.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 09:59:28):
An ancient beacon of the The Ravenous King's influence.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:00:00):
There is a gorilla-cultist in the corner of the room, he is cleaning the floor with a dirty rag.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:00:06):
He looks tired and worn down.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:00:31):
His eyes scream sadness and a hint of something more violent emerging.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:01:11):
The gorilla man looks at the group:
"What...what is...how are you all?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:03:14):
The gorilla-man has been whipped.

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-30 10:06:16):
*[gif]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:07:23):
Dhira Gray-Cheeks looks surprised at Daichi.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:07:43):
Tavik doesn't seem to care too much.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:09:15):
The gorilla cultist says:
"I am Ngira."

**Antoine / Anthony = Allisee** (2025-03-30 10:09:56):
*[image]* When you try to be batman but the dice said no.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-30 10:10:20):

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-30 10:11:17):
"Forgive Daichi, he wants to save his wife"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-30 10:13:06):
Lorn does a deep sigh " I still wonder how father can be so patient with your kind"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-30 10:15:00):
"Names can have alignments?"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:17:15):
Corbin continues:
"My father will know more about this...."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:17:19):
Corbin looks sad.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:19:09):
Corbin continues:
"One of those gifts was a holy name to help elevate me in the esteem of the Ravener."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:19:37):
Corbin raises his left gorilla paw and points to his fingers with his right hand:
"I have also been blessed with a 6th finger mutation."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:28:06):
Corbin:
"It's nice to hear different sects do different things."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:28:09):
Corbin tries to smile.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:28:16):
Corbin fails to smile.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-30 10:36:00):
"Corbin if you help us I promise that I shall help you find a gorilla woman companion"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-30 10:37:46):
"Why are you alone and sad here in this room cleaning the floor"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-30 10:40:42):
Lorn looks a bit embarrassed "Oh my bad. Anyway could you help us pass the next room?"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-30 10:42:27):
"Indeed"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-30 10:45:22):
Lorn attempts to establish again a mindlink with Aderne "Priestess I kind of need help with convincing this gorilla cultist that we need to enter his father room
Could you give me something to remind him that you are their guest"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:52:52):

@Nemesiux 

Now it's minimum 10 + 1d10.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:56:25):
Anyways: fail.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-30 10:56:54):
sad

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:56:58):
Corbin says:
"I must ask about this and looks at the shrine."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:57:04):
The shrine glows.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:57:31):
And from the shadows of the room...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:57:34):
*[image]*

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:57:40):
This woman appears in a flash of red light.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-30 10:58:10):
"Greetings, your lady I assume"

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 10:58:12):
Corbin says:
"Sanura, these strangers want to see my father."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 11:00:09):
Sanura:
"You may lie to little Corbin here, but I am a demon. Tread carefully mortal."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 11:00:18):
Corbin looks at Sanura with a purple glow in his eyes.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 11:15:53):
Corbin:
"But my love, I will fight them for you my love."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 11:16:10):
Sanura:
"Ah Corbin, Corbin.
You are still not finished.

Open the door."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 11:16:39):
Sanura:
"One day you will lead all of Holy Xatramba, but you must live to do so."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 11:16:51):
Corbin nods and walks over to the shrine.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 11:17:17):
Corbin runs his hand along the runic tests of the shrine, the shrine is covered in what looks to be ancient lore.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 11:17:43):
The runes glow, a loud CLICK is heard, both door's runes are now no longer glowing.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 11:17:53):
The courtyard door is now: unlocked.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 11:20:10):
Next? :)

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-30 11:23:25):
Lorn looks a bit sad "I am sorry Corbi for lying to you, but we have people that we care about too
Farewell. I hope in the future we will meet on better terms" 
Lorn follows Daichi after this

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-30 11:37:56):
Lorn mentally whisperes to Aderne, "My father once fought one of those beings in Cheliax. Lust without love or devotion is as  hollow as an empty grave. 
The succubus failed to seduce him even worse for her she only found sadness followed by a burning grey flame rage...... she died begging to be spared.
Never trust demons my priestess unlike devils they are slaves to their own sins just like the runelords"

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-30 11:39:38):
"if what the demons say is true he will make a fine meal for our familly
The divine sparks that he will gather will greatly sate our hunger"

Also as you leave, you notice the private shrine has a gemstone with divine runes.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 11:47:59):
The gemstone looks to be worth 140 GP.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 11:48:17):
Anyone with expert in religion will know by looking at the gemstone it likely transforms somehow.

The Sacrificial Plaza of Forgotten Gods.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 12:08:01):
The Plaza Overview.

The vast plaza lies exposed beneath an unforgiving sky, where neither stars nor sun seem to cast their true light, but rather gaze down like distant, uncaring eyes. 

The air tastes metallic and carries the scent of ozone and decay.

 Those with arcane sensitivity feel a persistent pressure behind their eyes—the weight of countless ancient rituals that have thinned the boundaries between realms. 

The stones themselves seem to hunger, drinking in both blood and fear with equal relish.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 12:09:08):
The Broken Pillars (North, East, South).

Lining the Northern, Eastern, and Southern perimeters stand twelve obsidian pillars—once majestic supports for a long-collapsed temple roof—now terminating in jagged, crystalline fractures that weep a viscous amber fluid when moonlight touches them. 

The liquid pools and evaporates before dawn, leaving behind faint whispers that linger until sunrise. 

During the equinox, when the angle of light aligns precisely with these broken sentinels, their shadows converge upon the central rune, and for a brief moment, reality itself shivers in recognition of something vast and terrible stirring from its slumber.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 12:09:32):
The Western Wall and Grotesque Visage.

The Western wall looms as a canvas for some mad sculptor's masterwork: a colossal visage carved and painted with pigments that should have faded centuries ago, yet remain unnaturally vibrant. 

The face combines simian features with reptilian scales that seem to undulate subtly when viewed from the corner of one's eye. 

Its horns—massive ivory protrusions veined with copper—arc across the entire wall, forming an archway above two pairs of weathered doors crafted from some unknown metal that absorbs rather than reflects light.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 12:09:59):
The Drinking Pool.

Nestled within the creature's gaping maw on the Western wall lies a semicircular pool lined with stone teeth that occasionally grind against one another when no one is watching. 

The water within remains perfectly still regardless of wind, unnaturally clear and sparkling, 
rejecting anything placed within except for living blood, 
which it greedily consumes with a soft hissing sound. 

Some swear they've glimpsed pale, childlike faces peering up from its depths before being dragged away by unseen hands.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 12:12:32):
The Central Rune.

Dominating the plaza's center, an enormous rune stretches nearly forty feet across—a crude, multi-limbed figure whose extremities end in too many fingers. 

The deep grooves of the carving pulse with a faint indigo luminescence during the three nights of the new moon. 

Ancient bloodstains have seeped permanently into the stone, forming patterns that scholars claim represent constellations not visible from this world. 

It is said that those who die here never truly leave, their essence bound eternally to the ancient pact that keeps whatever lies beyond at bay...

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 12:12:57):
The Eastern Doors (Ancient Main Entrance).

Massive stone doors dominate the Eastern wall—clearly the original main entrance to this unholy place. 

Towering twenty feet high and carved with intricate symbols that burn the eyes of those who study them too closely, these monolithic portals have remained sealed for millennia. 

The party has already glimpsed these doors from the opposite side, though they appear markedly different from this angle—as if the stone itself changes its nature depending on which side one stands. 

Faint, ghostly handprints cover the plaza-facing surface, left by those who desperately tried to escape whatever horror pursued them.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 12:15:04):
The Western Doors (Sweat Shop and Hand Gallery).

Two smaller sets of double doors punctuate the Western wall beneath the grotesque carving's watchful gaze. 

The leftmost doors are forged of blackened stone (with bone inlays on the courtyard side).

The sourthern door (the door the group are entering through) is adorned on the courtyard side with hundreds of tiny carved hands that seem to reach out toward passersby. 

This door is the one which the party now cautiously emerges into this chamber of ancient malevolence.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 12:15:56):
The walls of this plaza run very very high.

Light seems not bother by this depth, shining on downwards via some kind of light-bending magics.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 12:16:09):
You are underground, deep unground and yet you are outside, clear as day.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 12:17:42):
Near the old man is a demon raptor.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 12:17:48):
And two gorilla cultists.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 12:18:06):
The old man does not look surprised by the party's presence and he laughs, a wide smile across his face.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 12:20:27):
The old man stands, turning to the group and says:
"Hahaha."

He laughs with such genuine joy it is quite disarming, then says:
"Nyamat Mshwe. 

That's my name.

But, as my son told you, it is but a holy name.

You may call me Theron."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 12:20:39):
Theron:
"It's Azlanti for Hunter you know."

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 12:21:11):
Theron looks at the group with this enamoured curiosity.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-30 12:22:47):
Despite his age, Theron is a tall and imposing man.  

Theron has thick, graying hair and a big, bushy beard.

Theron has six fingers on each hand. 

Theron prominently wears his religious symbol of Angazhan—a spiked rune just like the symbol carved into the floor of this plaza—on a heavy-looking gilded gold necklace.

**Path Wars** [GM] (2025-03-31 14:56:51):
The cultists, the demon and gorillas watch patiently, saying nothing at this exchange.

**Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder]** (2025-03-31 15:11:55):
"You are correct.
 I am not alone anymore.
I am the priestess's angel
In a few years, neither will my brothers and sisters be alone for long once father achieves his goal
Although it is rude to ignore my question about your son Theron
My father hates parents who abuse their kids and so do I"
