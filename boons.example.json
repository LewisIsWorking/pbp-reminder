    "A street merchant gives you a small discount on your next purchase.",
    "You find a coin in your boot that wasn't there before. It's warm to the touch.",
    "A stray cat follows you for the rest of the day and hisses at anyone who lies to you.",
    "The next innkeeper you meet insists your money is no good here.",
    "A bird drops a shiny pebble at your feet. It glows faintly in moonlight.",
    "You wake up knowing a word in a language you've never studied.",
    "The wind changes direction to blow in your favour at exactly the right moment.",
    "A child in the street points at you and whispers to their friend that you look like a hero.",
    "Your next meal tastes slightly better than it has any right to.",
    "You spot a four-leaf clover growing through a crack in the cobblestones."
